    Chapter 176   Mythological World 5
   </h1>
   <p>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    The fact that the ruler of the world Finlandia people and their wise advocate Vanhutte tribe were turned into beastman race shook the politic landscape of the empire to the core.
   </p>
   <p>
    First, there was a doubt whether the beastmen were really Finlandia people who were transformed into that form or not. When it was proved to be fact by the related people, the empire was split into two.
   </p>
   <p>
    They were split into two camps, one camp wanted to exterminate the Finlandia people who lost their mana to become the new ruler, and the other camp wanted to protect the blessing from their knowledge.
   </p>
   <p>
    Although they had lost their mana, the governing system and the majority of the magic technology were under the management of Vanhutte tribe.
   </p>
   <p>
    If they rejected the order that had been maintained until now and lost it, the decline of Aurelia Continent’s civilization would be unavoidable and chaos would reign.
   </p>
   <p>
    However at this point of time, the majority of people thought that there was no need to rush. They could just calmly wait for their position to rise.
   </p>
   <p>
    After all was said and done, Finlandia people were an absolute minority in this continent. The number of Aurelia people who inherited their wisdom kept increasing each year from places like the magic school in Constantinos.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was no reason to brave danger just to remove them.
   </p>
   <p>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    ──But that flow changed due to the appearance of a young man.
   </p>
   <p>
    The young man who introduced himself as Maximilian Robespierre won the people as his ally using his skillful oratory skill. He incited them by claiming that all equality and poverty were the fault of Finlandia.
   </p>
   <p>
    The mass was glued to the speech of the young man who didn’t have any title at all.
   </p>
   <p>
    He was undoubtedly a natural born agitator.
   </p>
   <p>
    He was innocent, selfless, and smart. Because of that he possessed all the factors as a merciless revolutionary through and through.
   </p>
   <p>
    This young man was none other than the reincarnation of Maximilian Robespierre, the demon king who led that dark French Revolution and massacred the governmental people by tens of thousands.
   </p>
   <p>
    「The foreigners who reigned above the people of our continent without any right at all are slave who rebel against mankind and the world!」
   </p>
   <p>
    He brazenly proclaimed the extermination of Finlandia people who acted as the statesmen.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Equality is the only principle that matter. Inequality is the root of all evil. Now is the time to eliminate Finlandia people, the symbol of inequality!」
   </p>
   <p>
    It was nothing more than a small amount of incitement, but it spread from the capital to the whole continent in the blink of eye.
   </p>
   <p>
    The people weren’t oppressed at all by the current government, but it was the fact that the livelihood of Aurelia people was poorer than Finlandia people, and that they were the one who was made to do the dangerous works. And the greater the number of excellent people was, the more there would be people who dreamed to drive out the current ruler and climbed up to become the new ruler themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    Robespierre quickly received the support of tens of thousands of people. He unleashed his poison toward the mass at the Tuileries Plaza that was located at the center of the capital.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Kill! The era of their virtueless rule is over, the new dawn has arrived. They have to atone for that dawn with their blood!」
   </p>
   <p>
    That wild enthusiasm swept over the capital Constantinos swiftly.
   </p>
   <p>
    If Vanhutte tribe was still powerful like in the past, it would be easy to suppress the riot. There was how wide the gap was between Vanhutte tribe and the humans of this continent.
   </p>
   <p>
    It wasn’t any exaggeration. If Vanhutte researchers seriously used their anti-personnel magic without any limit, it was also possible for a mere hundred people of Vanhutte tribe to exterminate all the people in Vanhutte continent.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a difference that had been there by birth. An absolute wall that was completely unrelated with equality and couldn’t be overturned.
   </p>
   <p>
    However currently Vanhutte tribe had lost their precious mana.
   </p>
   <p>
    They already lost the means to oppose the violence of number. They barely maintained the equilibrium using their precious magic tool, but the riot that was caused by Robespierre’s incitement overturned that state of equilibrium from its base.
   </p>
   <p>
    The first place that was targeted was the empire research facility that was managed by Zoras.
   </p>
   <p>
    The research facility’s magic security was dispelled by Aurelia researchers who were ardent supporter of Robespierre.
   </p>
   <p>
    Because of that the research facility fell under the surprise attack of the rioters.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Kill!」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Kill!」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Kill!」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Hurry with the activation of the defense barrier! Don’t let them get away!」
   </p>
   <p>
    A massacre began.
   </p>
   <p>
    The combat strength of Finlandia people who lost their mana wasn’t any different from the people of Aurelia continent.
   </p>
   <p>
    If there was no difference, there was no way they could win against the power of number.
   </p>
   <p>
    The few magic tools that were still operating prevented the entry of the rioters. The researchers of Vanhutte tribe searched for a chance to escape using that opening, but they were unlucky.
   </p>
   <p>
    Currently the Aurelia researchers in this research facility were all people who colluded with Robespierre.
   </p>
   <p>
    The researchers who were close with Zoras like Meira and Ratash were away from the capital to build a new magic facility at Mejina region.
   </p>
   <p>
    Because of that almost all of the remaining staffs were enemies of Vanhutte tribe.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Uwaaaaaaa! Stop! Don’t come!」
   </p>
   <p>
    「You barbarians who would be no different than monkey if not for our wisdom……!」
   </p>
   <p>
    Just how great their regret was to be killed in this foreign land?
   </p>
   <p>
    The Vanhutte researchers who were about to be killed fell in despair and hated the people of Aurelia continent.
   </p>
   <p>
    They didn’t come to this land because they wanted it.
   </p>
   <p>
    They wanted to go home right away if it was possible. They didn’t come here to invade Aurelia and enslaved the people, not at all, nor did they have any intention for that.
   </p>
   <p>
    And yet they were going to be killed unreasonably like this. It was something that they couldn’t tolerate.
   </p>
   <p>
    「No-! I’m going home! I’m definitely going home!」
   </p>
   <p>
    It was then one of the researchers activated the process for dimension boundary tuning. He was betting on the possibility of one in ten thousand, no, one in a hundred million to go home.
   </p>
   <p>
    Of course, the required mana for powering the process had been consumed in the previous experiment.
   </p>
   <p>
    The tuning itself also couldn’t be said as perfect by any means. In the end it only resulted with the process going awry.
   </p>
   <p>
    But even knowing really well that this was how it would end up, who could possibly blame him for trying to grasp at the last ray of hope like that?
   </p>
   <p>
    In the end, two, three more people who sympathized with him appeared. In the end, the researchers of Vanhutte tribe who gathered in the experiment room numbered ten-odd people. They’d rather make such hopeless bet if they were going to get killed anyway.
   </p>
   <p>
    「──So only this many survives.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Everyone else has died……」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Those barbarians, they don’t know how much we want to return home to Finlandia……」
   </p>
   <p>
    They were already losing their hope to escape.
   </p>
   <p>
    The experiment room was located at the center of the research facility. All the corridors that connected to outside from there were already occupied by the rioters.
   </p>
   <p>
    「At least just one more time. I want to see that nostalgic sky again!」
   </p>
   <p>
    The available mana wasn’t even one percent of the required amount. It was clear that the experiment would end in failure.
   </p>
   <p>
    But, if there was a chance, then they wanted to cling on it no matter how small it was. If that was impossible, then they wanted to see the scenery of their homeland at least one more time.
   </p>
   <p>
    The men pushed the activation switch of the dimension boundary tuning device with that thought occupying their mind.
   </p>
   <p>
    「This place huh!」
   </p>
   <p>
    The rioters finally arrived at the experiment room’s door.
   </p>
   <p>
    「It won’t open!」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Shit! The magic inhibition device is in operation!」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Just destroy it!」
   </p>
   <p>
    They began to destroy the door using human wave tactic, then they saw the tables and racks that were piled up to barricade the door.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, the activation switch was already pressed at that time. The tuning device began to work silently.
   </p>
   <p>
    For better or worse, the tuning of dimension boundary was lacking mana too much just as they thought. The scene that they were seeking to see in the monitor wouldn’t appear.
   </p>
   <p>
    「──So it’s impossible huh……」
   </p>
   <p>
    The researchers of Vanhutte tribe who were glaring at the monitor while groaning in vexation were killed one after another.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Destroy that machine!」
   </p>
   <p>
    From the perspective of the rioters, it would be troubling if Finlandia people regained their strength by any chance.
   </p>
   <p>
    With such simplistic thinking, the crystallization of knowledge that was built up with tons of effort, the dimensional boundary tuning device was destroyed completely.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nobody at that time knew what kind of result that would bring.
   </p>
   <p>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Zoras learned of that sad news at the next day.
   </p>
   <p>
    He correctly discerned the seriousness of the situation when he heard about the course of events.
   </p>
   <p>
    「This place is also dangerous.」
   </p>
   <p>
    If the rioters took control of the capital, it was clear that sooner or later they would also advance to the surrounding region.
   </p>
   <p>
    They too would definitely come to kill Zoras for the sake of their pretext.
   </p>
   <p>
    「……So only the five of us are remaining huh.」
   </p>
   <p>
    The one who said that with a desolate smile was Zoras’s colleague, Hamnes.
   </p>
   <p>
    He was older than Zoras. If he remembered correctly, he should have a wife and two children who were left behind in Finlandia.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Is it true that the tuning device in the lab was destroyed?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「If the story of the citizens who ran away from the capital is correct.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「I couldn’t imagine that our brethrens wouldn’t try to activate that device before they were killed. If we are unlucky than perhaps the situation would become the worst possible case.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「──What’s the worst that can happen?」
   </p>
   <p>
    Meira gulped seeing Zoras’s complexion turning deathly pale and she asked the question.
   </p>
   <p>
    「In the worst case an encroachment of dimensional boundary will begin. This world will be encroached by influence from another world, changed, and in the worst case this world would be swallowed.」
   </p>
   <p>
    This worry of Zoras would prove to be right, thought not completely.
   </p>
   <p>
    The worst didn’t happen because as expected, the amount of mana used was too few.
   </p>
   <p>
    However the encroachment from other world was starting to gnaw into this Aurelia continent, slowly but surely.
   </p>
   <p>
    In other words, the awakening of reincarnator other than Robespierre due to the encroachment from another world was also starting to occur.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not long after the capital was occupied by Robespierre and his faction, an opposition force rose to action in the sub capital Dynabar.
   </p>
   <p>
    A young man smiled leisurely while waving his hand toward the people from a balcony.
   </p>
   <p>
    「I wish for war. Therefore, all my methods are justified.」
   </p>
   <p>
    Only one person could reign at the top of the empire.
   </p>
   <p>
    There were a lot of ambitious people in the empire who didn’t want to hand over that position to Robespierre.
   </p>
   <p>
    The son of Dynabar’s governor-general was also one of those rival chiefs. He was blessed with exceptional eloquence and eye for strategy.
   </p>
   <p>
    The name of that young leader was Augusto Dynabar while his name at the present time was Adolf Hitler.
