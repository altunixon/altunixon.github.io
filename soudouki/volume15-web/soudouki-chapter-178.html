   <p>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Augusto nodded with an astonished expression. Perhaps he had half expected Shue’s confession.
   </p>
   <p>
    「So that’s why your information sounds like they come from the person directly involved.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「──Your majesty.」
   </p>
   <p>
    Shue turned her gaze back to Baldr and bowed her head with an earnest gaze.
   </p>
   <p>
    「I think your majesty already understand now, what your majesty is trying to do is loosening the seal applied to the boundary with other world. It will cause encroachment to begin once more. No, the encroachment is already beginning. There are two choices that we can take, not using weapon and tactic from another world and applying the incomplete seal once more, or completing the seal completely this time using your majesty’s own strength.」
   </p>
   <p>
    It was impossible to go to war without using modern weapon like firearm anymore at this point. And most of all, the other world knowledge had been used for manufacturing industries like textile and salt and others, financial system, and even intelligence organization.
   </p>
   <p>
    It wasn’t realistic at all trying to remove them completely at this point.
   </p>
   <p>
    In other words, Baldr’s only option was to win the war and complete the seal.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Is it because his majesty possess both the mana of this world and the mana of beastman──Finlandia people?」
   </p>
   <p>
    Shue nodded at Augusto’s question.
   </p>
   <p>
    「All owner of King’s Gate had definitely experienced in the verge of death once without exception. That’s because the soul was trying to return to Finlandia from the dimensional boundary due to death. During that time, sometimes the soul would receive interference from other dimension and people from other world would reincarnate to this world. The probability of that is really low, the reincarnation can also happen with the soul of this world instead of other world. I’m a good example of that.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「That means, King’s Gate is manifested due to interference of other world and possessing the mana of Finlandia?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「As expected from the prime minister. You understand it really well.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Why don’t you apply the seal by yourself?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Perhaps because I’m reincarnated from Meira who was a resident of this continent, I’m weighed down by that personality and unable to control the beastman’s power well. I have attempted to correct this many times until now but……」
   </p>
   <p>
    「I see.」
   </p>
   <p>
    Because King’s Gate was too powerful, it was made so that the seal couldn’t be unlocked as long as a secret ritual wasn’t performed in the beast god shrine.
   </p>
   <p>
    At present the beastman race had lost even the story behind that tradition.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Is that also the reason why the beast king was killed in the past?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「The beast king didn’t agree to seal the power of King’s Gate, rather he tried to make the beastman country prosperous by wielding that strength proactively. That wasn’t something that could be allowed by the people in the position of protecting the seal.」
   </p>
   <p>
    If the beast king wielded the power of other world without limit, the seal would dissolve and this world would be exposed to danger. Perhaps the beast king’s little brother from different father, Philiste also murder the beast king with a very heavy heart.
   </p>
   <p>
    No, if anything, the possibility was high that if Baldr was born in that era, he would be regarded as danger right from the beginning and killed.
   </p>
   <p>
    「I understand now. For them, his majesty is an opponent that has to be killed no matter what they have to do.」
   </p>
   <p>
    To be honest, even for Augusto it was quite puzzling why Europa church was so obstinate to that degree.
   </p>
   <p>
    Europa church was isolated at the middle of the continent and it wouldn’t be strange even if they perished anytime, but even in such situation they still wouldn’t come to the negotiation table and absolutely wouldn’t tolerate Baldr’s existence. That was because there was such reason behind it.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Then won’t it be impossible to reach an accord with the church even with the interference from Kadiros Kingdom?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Most likely the pope is the only one who know about this legend to some degree. In the end it’s fine even if we don’t manage to obtain peace. We only need to obtain the sealing artifact in the church’s possession by all means.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「I see……」
   </p>
   <p>
    That artifact would be the most important item even among the holy relics that the church possessed in order to achieve complete sealing.
   </p>
   <p>
    It seemed that the holy relic that was currently in their side’s possession wouldn’t be effective enough for it.
   </p>
   <p>
    「──Even so, I don’t think that they will obediently listen to our demand. It will be necessary to mobilize the army in order to shake them up won’t it?」
   </p>
   <p>
    Augusto suddenly noticed something strange when he tried to turn the talk toward Baldr.
   </p>
   <p>
    Baldr hadn’t said anything since some time ago.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Your majesty, do you have any thought?」
   </p>
   <p>
    Augusto only noticed Baldr’s strange condition at that time.
   </p>
   <p>
    Baldr’s face lost all color with cold sweat trickling down his forehead. He was clearly losing his composure.
   </p>
   <p>
    From the way Baldr look, it was unclear how much he had been listening of Shue’s story. It caused Augusto to lose his composure too.
   </p>
   <p>
    「W-what’s the matter your majesty?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「……You mentioned that as the result of the sealing, the reincarnated personality will be gone didn’t you?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Yes.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Then what will happen to my──to the personality of Sanai-dono and Masaharu-dono?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Ah!」
   </p>
   <p>
    It was thoughtless of Augusto. Until this moment he had forgotten that there were two reincarnators inside Baldr.
   </p>
   <p>
    Baldr had been together with them since he became aware of his surrounding as a child. Their existences were already inseparable from him.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was no way Baldr could stay calm when he was told that they would vanish.
   </p>
   <p>
    「With the seal removing the interference from other world, putting aside the knowledge and materials that are already used in this world, their souls will most likely──」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Will they return to their original world? You aren’t telling me that they will be erased aren’t you?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「I-I don’t know until that far……」
   </p>
   <p>
    If the boundary with other world was erased, the souls that came from other world might return to the place from where they came from. There was such theory, but it had never been tested before, so who could say what would actually happen.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Are you telling me to erase Sanai-dono and Masaharu-dono unknowingly!!」
   </p>
   <p>
    Although Shue had Meira’s memory, she was nothing more than a princess. She let out a short scream 「Hiih」 when she was exposed to Baldr’s angry yell right from the front and fell on her butt.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her whole body shook fiercely. Cold sweat drenched her whole body. Her dress stuck to her skin wetly.
   </p>
   <p>
    Baldr was the strongest King’s Gate owner in this Aurelia continent and he was starting to be equipped with the aura of a supreme ruler. Although Shue was a reincarnator, there was no way she was able to endure the anger of such person when she had never even stepped into battlefield.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was already fortunate for her that she could just barely protect her dignity as a maiden.
   </p>
   <p>
    「──Your majesty, anymore than that is…」
   </p>
   <p>
    Baldr finally realized that his anger was making Shue trembling when Augusto spoke admonishingly to him.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Forgive my rudeness. Please pardon me for now. I wish to take some time for myself.」
   </p>
   <p>
    After Baldr said that, he didn’t even wait for Shue’s reply and turned around to leave the king’s hall.
   </p>
   <p>
    Shue could only watch him left with a dumbfounded look. Augusto smiled wryly and offered his right hand to Shue who was still sitting on the floor.
   </p>
   <p>
    「From my observation, it seems that you are still perceiving yourself as Meira. That’s why, are you perhaps thinking that even if the personality of the reincarnators vanished, you will simply die?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Yes……but, I see now that his majesty Baldr has his own personality. There shouldn’t be any problem even if his reincarnator personality vanish shouldn’t it?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「There is a problem. If I can say, what are you telling his majesty is no different than asking him to offer his family members as sacrifice. Even if that is simply a fact that isn’t filled with malice, it’s a different problem whether the person can accept it calmly or not.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「That’s……」
   </p>
   <p>
    From the past cases, almost in all cases the former personality would be taken over when the previous life’s personality was resurrected due to the overwhelming amount of information.
   </p>
   <p>
    However Baldr had taken control of those personalities. It was something shocking. But Shue misjudged the strength of his will.
   </p>
   <p>
    Baldr’s personality wasn’t taken over because the personalities of Sanai and Masaharu competed with each other, and it was also a miracle that was achieved due to Maggot’s immense love to her son. It wasn’t because Baldr had an inhuman will of steel.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Don’t tell me that his majesty will──」
   </p>
   <p>
    Would he oppose the sealing just like the beast king in the past?
   </p>
   <p>
    If that was the case, then Shue would also have to consider what she should do from the foundation.
   </p>
   <p>
    She told the truth to Baldr because she was convinced that Baldr wouldn’t be inconvenienced at all even if his reincarnator personalities vanished.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the worst case, Shue too would have to turn Baldr into enemy and fought him with all her strength.
   </p>
   <p>
    Baldr who possessed an independent self and had absorbed the knowledge of other world would be able to exert his strength sufficiently even if the dimensional boundary with other world was completely sealed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Rather with the threat of other world’s encroachment gone, Baldr’s reign should become even more rock solid.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Your highness Shue──no, perhaps I should call you Meira-dono right now……」
   </p>
   <p>
    Augusto shrugged in exasperation.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Aren’t you too strongly set on the idea that reincarnators are unneeded for this world?Do you think that your parents won’t feel any sadness at all if you vanished?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「That’s──obviously they won’t. After all I’m nothing more than an outsider who is renting this body.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Will you not care no matter what happen to your current parents his majesty the king and her majesty the queen just because you are an outsider and not their real daughter?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「T-that’s──」
   </p>
   <p>
    Even if she was an outsider with different set of memory, her memory of living together with them and being generously given their affection wouldn’t vanish.
   </p>
   <p>
    Meira tried to object that her biological parents were someone else, but she herself realized that was something completely unrelated.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even if she was the personality of a complete stranger, Meira was forced to accept that she was still connected to this world and had feeling that she shared with them.
   </p>
   <p>
    But──
   </p>
   <p>
    Even then, the encroachment of other world had to be sealed at all cost. She couldn’t allow her family in this world, the future to be unreasonably destroyed by sense of values from other world that suddenly showed up without any warning.
   </p>
   <p>
    「It’s fine.」
   </p>
   <p>
    In contrast with his worlds, Augusto’s expression was sorrowful.
   </p>
   <p>
    The figure of his father who entrusted the country’s future to him and walked the path of his own ruin appeared in his mind.
   </p>
   <p>
    A statesman mustn’t fear casting away even their own family if it was required.
   </p>
   <p>
    No matter how much anger and sadness he felt mentally, there was no way Baldr would make the wrong decision in regard to this.
   </p>
   <p>
    Augusto held such high evaluation toward Baldr that he could trust him in that.
   </p>
   <p>
    「──Although, there is no way that he will be able to draw the line even then.」
