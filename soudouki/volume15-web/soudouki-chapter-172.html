    Previous life, and then King’s Gate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Those were large advantages that had brought Baldr victories until now. At present those were the most important secret of Trystovy Kingdom.
   </p>
   <p>
    If Princess Shue said that not only she knew about them, but also possessed them, she might become an even more formidable enemy than Answerer Kingdom.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Why do you think so?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Your majesty has noticed that I’m a possession of King’s Gate correct?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「I understand that you are a powerful opponent who rivaled a King’s Gate owner yes.」
   </p>
   <p>
    Augusto’s eyes snapped wide open in shock hearing Baldr’s words. He wasn’t aware that Shue possessed that much martial strength until this moment.
   </p>
   <p>
    The other party possessing a King’s Gate also meant that she had the strength to assassinate Baldr. Right now there were only Baldr and Augusto in this king’s hall right now while all the other people had been cleared out.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Your majesty, please inform me of something like that beforehand.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「──Don’t worry, because I’m stronger than her.」
   </p>
   <p>
    Baldr declared so with a quiet confidence. Shue unconsciously let out a wry smile to that.
   </p>
   <p>
    For her it was her first time being told something like that.
   </p>
   <p>
    Possessor of King’s Gate fundamentally didn’t have any opponent. This strength separated them from other people by that much, but for some reason there were multiple King’s Gate owner around Baldr, so it was possible to make a comparison.
   </p>
   <p>
    From Baldr’s observation, Shue was stronger than Satsuki, but she seemed to be equal or slightly superior to Gina.
   </p>
   <p>
    Either was she was still far below that silver demon.
   </p>
   <p>
    「So can I take it that knowledge of previous life is related to why I have to make peace with the church?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「As expected from your majesty Baldr, it’s exactly as your majesty surmised.」
   </p>
   <p>
    Shue smiled brightly and bowed.
   </p>
   <p>
    That gesture looked befitting for a girl her age and Baldr reflexively relaxed the tension in his shoulders slightly. Apparently it was fine to consider that at the very least they wouldn’t suddenly get into a fight with each other. After all the women around Baldr tended to talk with their fist.
   </p>
   <p>
    Especially the women who possessed King’s Gate.
   </p>
   <p>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    「It has been quite long. Perhaps I should go to train that lazy son of mine hard?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「I’m feeling pent-up for some reason nya……. In that case I’ll sneak into Baldr’s bed tonight nya!」
   </p>
   <p>
    Baldr who completely forgotten that female King’s Gate owner was an esper in a sense.
   </p>
   <p>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    「I’m aware that your majesty has recovered a holy relic of the church, but the church also has three other holy relics than that. All of them are passed down as item to suppress the King’s Gate.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「I have experienced that with my own body.」
   </p>
   <p>
    Baldr had the experience of almost dying thanks to that holy relic. It was only at that time that he was thankful to Maggot for raising him without relying on King’s Gate.
   </p>
   <p>
    「That thing’s original role isn’t for that kind of trivial use.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「──What did you say?」
   </p>
   <p>
    While her statement that sealing a King’s Gate was something trivial was already attention grabbing, Shue’s firm words that it wasn’t the relic’s original ability made Baldr frowned.
   </p>
   <p>
    He got the hunch that he had just been told about something outrageous.
   </p>
   <p>
    「To explain about that, first I’ll have to tell the history about this continent and how our Kadiros Kingdom came into being.」
   </p>
   <p>
    Because everything began from a mistake of the past that had been erased from history.
   </p>
   <p>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    「──There were foreigners who came to this continent in the past. They were sent here due to a forbidden weapon that was used in war. ……They came from another world.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Another world you say?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Yes.」
   </p>
   <p>
    Baldr had the memory of his previous lives, but in the end he was still a human of this world. He had never heard of a story someone from another world coming to this world not through reincarnation but teleportation.
   </p>
   <p>
    「They possessed extremely developed magical culture and passed that magic technique to us humans who were still uncivilized at that time. However at the same time, the extremely large gap of strength between two sides changed the standing of both sides into master and servant.」
   </p>
   <p>
    Even though there wasn’t any qualitative difference between humans, there were qualitative difference in education and skill.
   </p>
   <p>
    In reality deciding which one was the lord and which one was the servant was decided by that kind of difference.
   </p>
   <p>
    Of course, it was another matter whether the people involved could accept it or not.
   </p>
   <p>
    「It seems that at first they were a small group who numbered only around several hundred people. They interacted with human and secured a base in this continent to live. After that the first thing they did was──」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Returning home to their original world huh?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「That’s right. They began experimenting using their magic technology to return back to their former world once more.」
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Well of course they would,
    </em>
    Baldr thought.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was only human to want to return home if they came to an undeveloped world and forced to live an inconvenient life.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Then did they succeed in returning home? Or perhaps Kadiros Kingdom is the descendant of those people?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「The problem is there. They completed the magic formula to return home by investing all the technologies they had. Theoretically all of them should be able to return back to their birthplace. However, the experiment ended half successful and half failure.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「There are a lot of implication in your words.」
   </p>
   <p>
    By half successful, did she mean that half of them were able to return home? Or perhaps they were pulled back forcefully in the middle of returning to their homeland?
   </p>
   <p>
    They left behind ancient technology like that holy relic. That meant that race shouldn’t exist in this continent at present.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Their body──had most likely gone home successfully. However their souls were unable to return home. It didn’t stop there, new flesh bodies were brought from another world somewhere as though to replace the body they lost.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「That’s completely a serious accident ain’t it!」
   </p>
   <p>
    In other words, when their experiment ended, they realized that their body had become something else that they had never seen before.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Furthermore problematically that body didn’t have any mana.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Oi oi, don’t tell me──」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Yes, that was the beginning of the beastman race.」
   </p>
   <p>
    Why was beastman race born without having any mana at all? The living things in this continent were born possessing some amount of mana whether it was few or a lot. But the beastman race was the only exception to that.
   </p>
   <p>
    But if their body wasn’t from this world in the first place, it explained why.
   </p>
   <p>
    「The tribe that had ruled over this continent until then suddenly vanished, after that some existences with foreign appearance were left behind in their place. The wave of persecution to the beastman race swiftly spread through the whole continent. With the loss of their mana, they created weapons that don’t need mana in order to survive.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「For example like those gunpowder weapons?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「That’s right. I heard that because they mainly used magic before that, they were unable to create weapons that were too advanced.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「As expected if they brought out things like minigun or tank then it would be too much even for me……」
   </p>
   <p>
    So that was why the specs of the holy relics weren’t that advanced. It was a small mercy.
   </p>
   <p>
    「After that they noticed a grave fact during their flight. The effect from the experiment still wasn’t over.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「Did their body get switched again?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「No──reincarnators from other world appeared one after another.」
   </p>
   <p>
    「What did you say?」
   </p>
   <p>
    Could it be that Masaharu and Sanai were reincarnated to this world due to the influence of an experiment from that long ago?
   </p>
   <p>
    As expected Baldr went pale hearing that.
   </p>
   <p>
    「The hole that was opened with magic to transfer to other world was fixed in place in an incomplete state. At that rate there was a risk that the order of the continent would be destroyed from its base by reincarnators from other world who possessed different culture and sense of value.」
   </p>
   <p>
    Certainly. In a sense what Baldr was trying to do could also be said as a denial of the order in Aurelia Continent that had been in place until now.
   </p>
   <p>
    If such thing happened like everyday occurrence, this world would be turned into chaos where the law of jungle was in effect.
   </p>
   <p>
    「──Though as poorly informed as I am, I know of no other reincarnator other than your majesty.」
   </p>
   <p>
    If there were that many reincarnators flooding this continent, then the world peace should have been destroyed since a long time ago.
   </p>
   <p>
    Augusto pondered that calmly.
   </p>
   <p>
    「──Exactly.」
   </p>
   <p>
    Shue nodded at Augusto.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Our Kadiros royal family was born in order to monitor reincarnator.」
   </p>
   <p>
    That was why they always paid attention to Baldr’s action until now.
   </p>
   <p>
    The testament that had been passed down through Kadiros Kingdom since the first generation gave them the duty that had to be carried out no matter what kind of sacrifice had to be paid.
   </p>
   <p>
    「Please allow me to talk about the reason for that.」
   </p>
   <p>
    Shue lightly closed her eyes and looked up to the sky as though in prayer.
   </p>
   <p>
    「The story that I will tell from here is a secret that has been passed down in our royal family, and a memory from my past life.」
