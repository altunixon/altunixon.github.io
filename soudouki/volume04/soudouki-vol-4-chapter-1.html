     Part 1
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s group accomplished their role as goodwill ambassadors to Sanjuan Kingdom and returned home. What was waiting for them was a celebration that was held by Mauricia Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although it was only as an adopted daughter, his friend Teresa had become the daughter of Welkin, the fully-fledged king of Mauricia Kingdom. And that girl became engaged with Sanjuan Kingdom’s new crown prince, Franco.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was, of course, the result of the two’s love of one another.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, it was also a fact that the matters wouldn’t have developed like this without Baldr, who had been dragged into the succession of Sanjuan Kingdom’s throne. Allying himself with the navies of Sanjuan Kingdom and Majorca Kingdom, he played an active role in the battle against the pirate group that had used the Trystovy Dukedom as their stronghold.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The engagement of Mauricia Kingdom’s second princess Rachel met a setback due to the death of Abrego, the previous crown prince of Sanjuan Kingdom. Because of that, the Mauricia palace was astir with celebration that was more than necessary.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Princess Teresa, banzai!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Mauricia Kingdom, banzai!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「King Welkin, banzai!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The commoners were exploding with excitement over this Cinderella story that was unexpectedly taking place.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From the beginning, commoners loved this kind of success story.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course, Teresa was still a noble albeit a low ranked one, so she wasn’t a commoner. However, her Bradford family came from the lineage of knights that obtained deeds of arms in war and entered the ranks of nobility.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if they were just a commoner right now, it might be possible for them to rise in the world and become royalty in the far future──such a dream was swelling inside the commoners and stirred them wild.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But, there also existed people who thought bitterly of such an atmosphere.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     These people were mostly the nobles who lost their special privilege due to Welkin’s structural reform and felt uneasy about their future due to the commoners encroaching into the workplace that was under their control.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Truly deplorable. To offer a mere daughter of a viscount to a royal family, even if they are the royal family of another country. The dignity of Mauricia Kingdom will be questioned like this!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That girl is also a badly-behaved child who likes to dress as a man. Won’t such girl give birth to a seed of disaster between us and the Sanjuan Kingdom instead?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There are many other young ladies who are more worthy to be a crown prince’s wife. In the first place, why can’t her highness Rachel take this role?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Military nobles who had territory in remote regions tended to be looked down even among the nobles. It was shocking news for these people that a daughter from such a noble would become the wife of a crown prince.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They could still accept it if the girl came from the royal family or from one of the ten great nobles.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, of all people, it was a little girl from a military noble that had no other talent except swinging a sword that obtained this honor. For this girl to go over their heads and get adopted into the royal family, it made them feel like even their authority, which was the last bastion of their pride, was being violated.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Do you all think that it’s fine for things to keep going like this?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Shh! You mustn’t say anything thoughtless. That king is famous for his sharp ear.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph! No one among us could possibly be a traitor!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The one who said that was Count Hendrick Hastings(ヘンドリック- ヘイスティングス). He was a man in the middle of his thirties and put on an air like he was the leader of this noble gathering. He stood up with a loud rebuke.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Authority is something that is always shifting. Certainly at the present time, we might be in a relatively low social position. However, have you all forgotten? Until that war, the royal court was unable to control both the bureaucrats and the military. If only that war didn’t happen, the royal family wouldn’t be able to raise their head towards the ten great nobles even now!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This statement could be said to completely hit the mark.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Until ten years ago, the nobles didn’t need to work this hard in order to maintain their authority.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rather, the king and the prime minister couldn’t even carry out their policy or tactics without the support of the nobles at that time, and they were frequently forced to compromise.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If only that war didn’t happen──although, many nobles became victims in that war and had their strength weakened due to running wild due to their own selfish motive──not one of them couldn’t stop from thinking that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The royal court spent these ten years expanding their own authority. The annoying commoner upstarts are supporting that. As a result, we are being isolated and have to be obedient to the royal court in order to survive.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Hendrick talked heatedly with a clenched fist.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Several of our comrades who shared our sentiment are already ruined. If we continue to remain a spectator like this, the day will come that we will lose the authority that is our right and be purged if we resist. The time is now for us to act for the sake of regaining our past glory!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「But if we’re too rash, we will be purged immediately, you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The bureaucrat nobles in the ministry of justice and ministry of finance who were punished as an example some time ago were still fresh in their memory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Naturally, they understood that it was a warning from the king.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Of course we won’t do this openly. Right now the conditions are too unfavorable. However, I have no intention for us to keep being a silent spectator forever……if our power was whittled down because of the war, then don’t you think that the opposite can also happen, that a war can also whittle down the power of the king?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For the ruined nobles who couldn’t change the situation with their own strength, Hendrick’s words sounded very alluring.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If the king’s power was reduced, then the noble’s power would also increase in proportion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They were thinking of this idea like it was a simple balancing scale, but by no means there were only the king and the nobles who were put on this scale.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Everything in this world──for example, Mauricia Kingdom’s bitter enemy, Haurelia Kingdom was also placed on both ends of the scale. This perspective was lacking in Hendrick’s words just now, but no one here noticed it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This short-sightedness was none other than the factor that led to their own ruin. But their pride was too much for them to realize this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 2
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Good grief, I was wondering just what in the world had happened when you wrote to me to take little miss Teresa as my adopted daughter.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I have no excuse at all.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr had the awareness that he had clearly asked for something unreasonable. He could only prostrate while sweat flowed from his forehead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In which world could there be a son of a count who demanded for the king to adopt someone?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although everything was fine and dandy because matters had been wrapped up safely without accident, it wouldn’t have been strange for heads to fly if it ended in failure.. Baldr felt a chill in his back after realizing this late that he had done something reckless.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Well, the result from it was the best possible result I could ask for. I’m satisfied that I can make Sanjuan Kingdom owe me a favor, but to think that you would go as far as finding a wife for the crown prince……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Welkin shrugged in amazement and laughed heartily.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In order to soothe the ruffled feathers after his refusal of the new marriage talk from Sanjuan Kingdom, Welkin sent Baldr there expecting that he would leave a good impression on them at best.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although this was Baldr he was sending, so Welkin thought that Baldr might be able to obtain some kind of new connection with Sanjuan Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr himself absolutely wouldn’t acknowledge it (Welkin was pitying him from the bottom of his heart regarding that), but Baldr had a troublemaker disposition where troubles would approach him without even him needing to do anything.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In a certain time, this was what people would call the hero’s destiny.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, Baldr interfered in the throne inheritance dispute, made the new prince owe him a great favor, and even mediated for his childhood friend to become the consort of the crown prince. Who in the world could possibly predict such a thing?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     With this, both countries became allied to each other with a closeness that surpassed Welkin’s imagination.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Welkin didn’t even need to send one of his dearly beloved daughters to another country for this. Even Teresa’s actual father, Mattis, was crying in happiness over his daughter’s match.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What was even more surprising was the fact that the newly appointed military minister of Sanjuan Kingdom formed a personal friendship with Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Mauricia Kingdom, being able to strengthen their cooperation with a country that possessed naval power was an achievement that couldn’t be ignored.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the fact that the female naval minister of Majorca Kingdom Urraca was seeking Baldr’s hand in marriage was a bit problematic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps this boy was a lady-killer that could even put his father Ignis to shame. Welkin thought to entrust Rachel to Baldr, but perhaps he should rethink the matter?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Either way, for Mauricia Kingdom that was fundamentally a country with only a land-based army, Sanjuan Kingdom’s navy was an irreplaceable existence for their strategy against Trystovy Dukedom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore, the pioneering of a sea route was a problem that they had to face one day in order to support the development of the domestic economy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Baldr Cornelius, you have produced a result that surpassed my expectations. Well, there are also various problems with it, but I shall not question them. After all, a snake might jump out if I unnecessarily poke the bush.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The new technologies like the compass and lightning rod that Baldr provided to Sanjuan Kingdom’s navy──it was possible to offer them immediately because they were a technology that Baldr himself secretly possessed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If those technologies were something that were under the control of Mauricia Kingdom, even Baldr would have to be cautious.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because of that, Welkin thought that it would be boorish to snatch the trust that Baldr had won. Also, he couldn’t think of anyone else other than Baldr who would be able to win the trust of the new military minister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr himself was still hiding many mysteries, but Welkin’s instinct that had served him for many years told him that it would be dangerous to turn Baldr and the people around him into enemies.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was unclear whether at this time Maggot, who was waiting for her son’s return back home, was sneezing or not.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──And, because of that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Welkin clapped his hands and leaned back heavily on his throne while laughing brazenly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His laughing face was cruel and merciless like a kid who had found something he loved to toy with. The prime minister Harold prayed for Baldr’s happiness in the next life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Those who were in the know knew who was moving behind the scene of Teresa’s moving tale.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if the person himself didn’t plan for this result, even if the majority of it was simply Baldr leaving the matter to take its own course, seeing only from the result, the great achievement that Baldr accomplished was something difficult to achieve even for any top class diplomat from any country.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In addition, Baldr also possessed his own personal distribution network through Savaran Company and a connection to a foreign country. In the slightest chance that the kingdom slighted Baldr, it was possible for him to turn into a terrifying enemy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Just as the saying 「The nail that sticks out gets hammered down」 went, a faction that perceived Baldr as an enemy of their interests and moved to remove him would certainly appear in the future.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Both Welkin and Harold didn’t have any intention to abandon this promising talent who shouldered the future of the kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In other words, they thought that it would be necessary to distance Baldr from the capital for a moment because he still wasn’t used to the conspiracies and schemes that were the royal court politics.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I shall promote you to viscount in light of your achievement this time. As well──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was a gamble.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He didn’t think that it was a gamble with bad odds, but Welkin thought that it was a slightly problematic gamble as a country’s leader.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, there was no doubt that this was a decisive moment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The time remaining for this country wasn’t that much. A mere makeshift solution would only create a breeding ground for future problems.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Now then, it was time to make the call.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I shall appoint you to be the feudal lord of Antrim that is currently under the direct control of the crown. Accept this appointment humbly.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (What the hell is this guy saying!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr wanted to yell that, but it was the words that directly came from the king himself and outwardly, it was a reward for him. It was nearly impossible for a retainer to raise an objection right from the front.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Shit-, he screwed me! This damn sly old fox!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no doubt that this appointment had been decided since he was chosen as an ambassador to Sanjuan Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Welkin promoted Baldr to be a feudal lord using a suitable achievement as the excuse.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Welkin was smiling very elatedly. It felt like his expression was saying 「Just as planned」.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A decent person most likely wouldn’t even think of this kind of idea.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all, Antrim was an auspicious territory of Mauricia Kingdom that was jutting out into Haurelia Kingdom’s territory. That area would also become the place where war with Haurelia Kingdom would break out.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Three of the four sides of the territory were surrounded by Haurelia Kingdom. This remote place was even called as “Mauricia Kingdom’s appendicitis” because of that. To leave such a place to an inexperienced boy like him, it could only be called political violence.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Depending on the situation, it was possible that the sparks of war between the two countries would be reignited once more.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Or perhaps that was Welkin’s aim from the start? If he could make the bureaucrats accept the military’s expansion by increasing the tension between both countries……the risk was high, but this sly old fox might really be scheming something like that…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──I accept this appointment with all due respect.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Umu, I expect that you will surpass my expectation without fail──because if not, I won’t be able to give you my daughter.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Welkin made the last part of his sentence muddied so Baldr wouldn’t be able to hear while he concluded the talk with a good mood.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Harold thought of the future of this boy who would be toyed around by Welkin even in the future and quietly wiped the tear forming in his eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 3
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Antrim──it was located around 320 kilometers north from Cornelius territory. It was located on the eastern tip of the mountain range Morgan, which had little in the way of level ground, just like Cornelius.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Viscount Bradford’s territory was located at the back of that Antrim. For Teresa’s family to be located nearby had an extremely large meaning in case they needed swift reinforcements.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although, the house of Viscount Antrim was annihilated to the last man before the reinforcements could arrive in the last war. This environment where the territory was surrounded from three sides by an enemy country could be said as a serious difficulty that beggared the imagination.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Antrim was placed under the direct control of the royal family since the death of the entire viscount family. The territory was ruled by the magistrate that was dispatched there, but the territory’s defense was in a state that hadn’t been touched at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The plan for this extremely hard to defend area until now was to swiftly abandon it the moment the war started. Therefore, Welkin predicted that the number of nobles who would criticize Baldr’s appointment to this territory would be small.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because it was obvious that everyone would shrink back if he told the detractors, 「Then how about I appoint you to rule that place instead?」.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No one would want to be given a dangerous territory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, this Baldr was a man who had overturned Welkin’s expectations several times until now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Welkin didn’t even consider that Baldr would quietly settle into the framework of a normal feudal lord.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Baldr produced a result that surpassed the imagination, there should be some people who would take action from the backlash of it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If things went well, a chance to drag out the harmful insects that were shutting themselves inside their hole and purge them away would surely arrive.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ku ku ku……don’t betray my expectation okay?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Soon it would be a good time to repaint the color of the kingdom──Welkin judged that from the viewpoint of a level-headed politician.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Strengthening international relationship with political marriage was necessary, but the relationship between the royal family and the domestic nobles was also just as important.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If marriage between royalty and noble was done carelessly, it might bring in high-handedness from the maternal relative. On the other hand, it was also an effective method to obtain a comrade who was capable and also loyal to the royal family.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course, he had no intention to force a marriage to his daughters with someone that they seriously hated.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Welkin was known as capable and scheming, but he had a side as a doting parent who mixed individual emotion when it came to family.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the first place, even if the rulers from all ages were investigated, there wouldn’t even be one among a thousand who was a perfect person who never brought personal feelings into public matters. And what was so bad about a father who treasured his daughter! Welkin seriously believed so.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rachel had never actually said it out loud, but Welkin was also aware that his daughter was harboring special feelings for Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps it hadn’t reached the level of love. Then it was the job of a capable father to give his daughter a push on the back. Welkin chuckled to himself fully intending to meddle with his daughter’s romance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──Rachel! Next is your turn to do your best!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 4
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Is Chichi-ue’s business with you over?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Baldr walked through the palace’s corridor, Prince William came talking to him with a sullen face for some reason.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr recalled when William was complaining that it was unfair in dissatisfaction because he couldn’t come along to Sanjuan Kingdom, but this person also wasn’t the type to hold a grudge this long.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr thought that William was just going to pester him for the tales of his travel, but this reaction was unexpected.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Looks like you were doing absurd things again, huh? Chichi-ue told me the stories while looking really happy. Hmph, how dare you have fun without me──well, I’m pitying you about Chichi-ue’s reward though. Tell me at any time if there is anything that I can do to help. Ah, that’s not it……a-anyways, come with me!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「In the end, what is it that you want to say, William?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t ask me!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     William was telling him to come along while he himself didn’t know what it was for. It was really unreasonable.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     William was already an audacious person from the start, but he could be talked rationally with. Baldr was puzzled by this chance of attitude.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Good grief, every last one of them──what is so good from a lady-killer like this……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     William was muttering curse-like words inside his mouth without saying it out loud.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For a young man with a siscon disposition like William who was in the middle of his puberty, Baldr was simply a friend in the end. He wasn’t someone that he wanted to call brother-in-law no matter what.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Long time no see, Baldr-sama. Even though I wanted to have a talk with you after finally recovering……but you went to Sanjuan Kingdom before I could……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr politely greeted back at Princess Rachel who was welcoming him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s great to see that your highness is looking well.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oh, even though you’re calling William without any honorifics. Don’t treat me as a stranger by calling me your highness like that. You’re my life’s savior, you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rachel smiled mischievously while leaning forward. The dress that she was wearing had the chest area largely opened. It was as though that area was inviting him while she was sending him an upward gaze from her leaning posture.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A place that he mustn’t see almost entered his sight. Baldr hurriedly averted his blushing face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    (As I thought, this person is also
    <ruby>
     that person’s
     <rt>
      Welkin
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    daughter──!)
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     How much did this family want to toy with him before they were satisfied?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ane-ue, aren’t you acting a bit immodest right now?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Do you think that you have the qualification to say that, you foolish little brother.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yes, I’m completely in the wrong just now.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Weak-! William, you’re weak–!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     William looked bashful from guessing what Baldr was thinking in his heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     William was rebellious towards his father and brothers, but for some reason he couldn’t oppose his sisters at all, no matter how old he had become.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Baldr-sama, you haven’t answered?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rachel smiled like a little devil. Her beautiful face made Baldr gulp even though he should have been used to it after spending time with beautiful girls like Seyruun, Selina, and Silk.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She had the bearing of someone who was aware of the height of her own status and used that as a weapon to add on to her charm further. It was something that could only be learned by someone who was born as royalty.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr wasn’t someone who would falter because of the difference in status, but it had to be said that he was slightly at a disadvantage when facing beautiful and older women.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Onee-sama, you’re being very proactive. But shouldn’t you hold back a little at least until I have the time to introduce myself?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I-i-i-it isn’t like I’m being impatient or anything!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When a teasing voice came from the girl with a jovial gaze who was sitting on the next chair, Rachel’s expression that had been composed until now became clearly agitated.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She waved her hands in a panic in front of her face and her face became bright red up until her neck. She couldn’t immediately say anything.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was puzzled at what was making her become that panicked, but then it seemed to offend William and he kicked Baldr’s shin angrily.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「OWWWWWW!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph, this damn blockhead!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You over there, William, don’t vent your anger on him too. You won’t be able to open your mouth again if Rachel-oneesama gets angry at you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sorry……please spare me just from that!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (This guy……is he really that Prince William? He isn’t a different person with the same face?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Or rather, is it really that bad if your big sister asked you to not open your mouth, William?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s nice to meet you for the first time. I am Rachel-oneesama’s little sister and William’s elder sister, Margaret(マーガレット). I have been wishing to meet and thank you one day. Thank you for saving the life of my precious big sister Rachel.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Unlike Rachel who had an elegant and neat atmosphere, Margaret was a lively girl whose vigor was overflowing from inside to enhance her beauty.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, behind her expression, it also felt like that the blood of Welkin had been passed down to her even thicker than Rachel.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr raised his guard inside his heart while bowing politely.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s an honor to be able to meet your highness Margaret. Please treat me well from here on too.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I also wish to get along with you even in the future. Perhaps it will be better if I start calling you brother-in-law from now?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Bufuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh!*
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rachel and William who were bringing their cup of tea to their mouth to calm down spat out their tea at the same time. Baldr’s ceremonial attire for having an audience with the king, which were few in number, was stained brown.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ma-Ma-Ma-Margaret! What are you saying so suddenly?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s right, Ane-ue! How can you speak about such a significant matter so nonchalantly──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hot-! Hot-! Hot-!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Is it alright? There is a gentleman who is about to get scalded by the tea that you two spurted out though.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aaaaaaaa! F-forgive me, Baldr-sama!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rachel noticed Baldr writhing around from the heat and pushed her handkerchief on his chest in panic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The tea seeped until his underwear too. In order to wipe off that part too, Rachel half-reflexively took off Baldr’s coat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The trained and lean white skin that couldn’t be imagined from looking through the clothes was exposed. Rachel finally realized what she was doing then.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oh my, Onee-sama, how bold!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「W-w-w-w-wrong! I-I-I-I have no ulterior motive at allll!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rachel turned red up to her ears and made excuses desperately. The composure of an older woman was already completely gone from her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed that Rachel was a very innocent and shy person at heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     On the contrary, Margaret, who was laughing in amusement, really looked like she had inherited her father’s blood just as thickly as expected.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Did you say something, Baldr-sama?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No, nothing.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This sharpness, there was no doubt. Welkin’s blood was undoubtedly inherited by this beautiful girl.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Fortunately, Baldr wasn’t scalded and he finally calmed down. He sipped at his tea that had turned cold.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A faintly sweet fragrance that seemed to come from the first pluck of tea leaves was still remaining in the cup.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You got the short end of the stick pushed on you even though you have saved Onee-sama. If you like, we will talk to Otou-sama about this so he will rethink it again.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The person who might become her brother-in-law was going to be sent far away, furthermore it was to a place where his life might be put into danger. Such a thing wasn’t desirable for Margaret.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although her true feelings were that she was feeling disappointed that an amusing toy like this would leave.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「T-that’s right! It will also be very hard to search for anyone who will be willing to work there……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Thank you for worrying about me, but I already accepted this royal command.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed the two princesses were reading too much into things, so Baldr replied to them assertively.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he was going to ask for the command to be withdrawn like this, it would be better to refuse it from the start. Now that he had accepted, he had a responsibility for the people of Antrim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore, Antrim was an area where it would be possible for him to support his birthplace──Cornelius, which was at the biggest risk for bearing the full brunt of Haurelia’s attack.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two princesses were unconsciously captivated by Baldr’s resolute bearing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although the two were driven with the sense of duty to say something to their father about this, in the first place they weren’t so ignorant of the world that they thought their selfishness would move Welkin to change his decision.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As for William, he could respect Baldr’s resoluteness as his best friend, on the other hand, he wanted to reproach him for  his defect as a lady-killer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A man who would still stand up even knowing the difficulty that was waiting for him and also possessing the ability to surpass that difficulty. The sisters knew just how much worth such a man had because they were royalty, who had the responsibility of assessing their spouse candidate.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (……Won’t it be better if I take him for myself instead of having him as a brother-in-law?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Margaret was aware that her father planned to have Baldr take Rachel who was older than her as his wife, but she reflexively thought of stealing Baldr from her blood-related sister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course she loved Rachel, but when it came to the problem of marriage, it was absolutely a competition. Depending on the calculation on interests and timing, there was even a possibility that she would get married with a dirty old man from another country as the second wife.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If there was an excellent product right before her eyes, then she would obviously prefer to be together with such a person. Anyone in her place would also do the same thing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「C-come to think of it, there is something that I wish to ask Baldr-sama……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rachel made up her mind and opened her mouth.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What is it?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The maid who nursed Baldr-sama back to health when you were infected, I heard that you will take her as your wife. There is also the lady from Savaran Company.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Your highness has very sharp ears.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He hadn’t even told his parents. Baldr broke into a cold sweat. The network of women really couldn’t be underestimated.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph, as I thought, I mustn’t let a lady-killer like you get near to Ane-ue!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Shut up.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Yes」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     William was easily shot down. After coming here, his stock in Baldr’s eyes had nose-dived to the bottom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「To take both of them as your wives, does that mean Baldr-sama doesn’t have the intention to be devoted to a single woman like Ignis-sama?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Actually, from the beginning, this was the only thing that Rachel was concerned about.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s father, Ignis, was famous as a lecher. But he fell deeply in love with the mercenary Maggot and married her in the end. It was a famous story about how after that he completely severed his relationships with other women.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although such a thing couldn’t be explained with only love as the reason (there was also the threat of physical punishment). But at the very least when seen from outside, it was a fact that since then Ignis didn’t even give a glance to another woman besides Maggot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If his son Baldr was going to marry his childhood friend, the possibility that he was also going to keep other woman at a distance just like his father couldn’t be said as low.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The only bright spot in this was that Baldr’s childhood friends were both commoners and there was a rumor that Baldr had no intention to make a distinction on which one would be the legal wife and the other would be concubine.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Your highness might think of me as an unfaithful man but──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There is no doubt about it, you bastard is an unfaithful man.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「William, the next time you speak needlessly, I’ll forbid you from getting within three meters from me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ane-ue, please be merciful!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This man was hopelessly weak against his big sister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Baldr was also aware enough that he wasn’t a worthy man for Rachel.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s pathetic, but I was unable to choose just one of them. Of course I intended to treat both of them as my legal wives, but the two of them rejected it……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Why did those two do that?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「They said that even after becoming my wife, they have no intention of giving up their current position. And so they told me to find a suitable woman to be my legal wife for the sake of Cornelius House.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As a maid, Seyruun had no intention at all to entrust the role of taking care of Baldr to another woman. Selina also had no intention to quit from being the president of Savaran Company now that the company was finally getting on track.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They couldn’t abandon their current self to serve as the first wife of Cornelius House.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two of them were holding a dream of having their feelings reach Baldr as lovers, but in front of the reality that was marriage, they still didn’t have the same strength as Maggot, who could kick reason to the curb.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Like that, the two girls who could be easily burning in jealousy were able to accept the reality unexpectedly easily.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Certainly from the outset it’s completely impossible to ask them to imitate that mother. And so we have no intention to hold the ceremony until I accept a legal wife first.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Is, that so……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      I’m really a filthy woman,
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rachel fell into a feeling of self-abhorrence. Even so she couldn’t hide her feelings of relief.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed Baldr had the intention of welcoming a legal wife outside of those two.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although from the perspective of a normal noble, it was Ignis and Maggot who were out of the norm. It was normal for a noble to marry concubines in order to leave behind offspring for the continuation of their house.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If by any chance Baldr died young, Cornelius House might go extinct in Ignis’s generation if things didn’t go well.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For the house that had continued for generations since their ancestor to go extinct was the greatest kind of dishonor based on this world’s common sense.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was why Viscount Antrim’s house that was annihilated was also detested throughout the kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Surely Baldr-sama will be able to find someone suitable for you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──
    </span>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      For example, how about someone like me?
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rachel didn’t say it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rachel too had surmised that Welkin’s calculation was for Baldr to go to Antrim territory, learn the know-how on how to manage a territory, and when he managed to raise achievements there, he would make Baldr marry his daughter.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In consideration of that, perhaps it could be said that she was the one who indirectly chased away Baldr to a remote region where his life would be exposed to danger.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When she thought that, her guilt towards Baldr grew and she was unable to speak as she pleased but──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「About that matter of legal wife, do you think someone like me would be fitting?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Eeeeeeh! You are saying that?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The way Margaret spoke without any bashfulness made the determination that Rachel had hardened herself to make wasted.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Or rather, the emergence of this completely unexpected rival made Rachel raise her eyebrows and glare at her little sister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It looks like there is a need for the two of us to have a talk.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Seems so. Perhaps there is a need to make a confirmation regarding the change in situation.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     William hallucinated invisible sparks where the two’s volatile gazes were clashing. He muttered with a small voice.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This is why I am opposed for this guy to meet with Ane-ue……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 5
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──Around that time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     An unseasonal dark cloud was hanging over the sky. It was bringing lightning together with a storm toward Cornelius with roaring thunder and whirling wind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The sky was getting dark like it was night. A flash of thunder ran through the sky and thunder echoed until the land.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A woman’s loud laughter was mixed among all those sounds.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For those who knew about the situation, that laughter only sounded like the trumpet of an angel that informed of the end of the world.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hee……my son is now the viscount of Antrim you say……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot’s voice was cold but still calm after hearing the message from the palace’s messenger.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Ignis and the mercenary Zirco who were listening were trembling uncontrollably with pale faces.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was a saying that a predator would look calm just before they devoured their prey. The two of them knew very well from experience that Maggot was exactly in such a state right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Your majesty, how can you……!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (It’s over……it’s over this time for sure……I wanted……to eat chief’s sweets one more time before I die!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s an unprecedented honor to rise in rank twice in such a short time. This humble self is truly filled with the feeling of congratulation.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The messenger, Benalith Southampton, was expressing his congratulation from the bottom of his heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The rise in rank was accompanied with danger, but the event that Baldr went through really should be called the dream of boys everywhere.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A young boy who was still too young to inherit the title of count from his father was rising in the world to be a fully-fledged feudal lord with his own territory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Depending on Baldr’s work in the future, it might become possible for him to unite Antrim and Cornelius along with the other area along the border into one and raising further in rank to become Margrave Cornelius. Or perhaps he would establish a separate house with the rank of marquis and enter the rank of the ten great nobles. Such things were possible.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The biggest problem was that the person himself along with his parents didn’t wish for such honor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Honor, huh.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot’s voice tone suddenly changed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The time had finally come. Ignis and Zirco stiffened in despair.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fufufufufufu……AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot held her stomach while laughing like a broken person. This complete change made Benalith frown.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if she was a countess, her attitude was still unbefitting toward a messenger from the palace like him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Do you know what kind of place that territory is? Just how many soldiers had died there?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The previous Viscount Antrim intentionally used himself and his family as shield in order to allow his people to escape, and they were subsequently annihilated. Right now there wasn’t a single person who could introduce themselves as an Antrim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Antrim had a geopolitical property that could endanger the capital of Haurelia, so if war broke out between the two countries, that land was an extremely dangerous place that was under the risk of immediate invasion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If the king claimed that being sent into such a place was a reward, Maggot’s feeling as a former mercenary declared that there was no worth in serving such a ruler.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If it was Maggot when she was still an active mercenary, the king’s head would already stop being attached to his body right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──It’s not a funny joke. Even adults have manners that have to be observed toward children. Is that baldy so incompetent that he has to rely on a child like this?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「H-how dare you! It doesn’t matter who you are, those words are the height of rudeness!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The people who were serving Welkin closely knew that in these recent years, Welkin was concerned by his receding hairline. However, Benalith couldn’t believe that there was someone who would openly touch the matter so insultingly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Just what did this woman think of the king?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m fine being rude. It’s stupid to show respect to the likes of the royal family!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Benality pulled out his sword towards Maggot with rage, but then his body stiffened as though there were stakes driven into his body.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A strong coldness that surpassed a mere chill assaulted his whole body.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His teeth were clattering. This man who didn’t shrink back even when facing the king of another country was drenched in greasy sweat and he was unable to even escape.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──Death was right here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was the unreasonable and tyrannical death that carelessly hunted life without even a shred of mercy. The avatar of such death was fixing her eyes on Benalith.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Benalith was already unable to think that it was arrogant for this woman to glare like that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Death was impartial to everyone whether it was towards the king or a commoner. It was the absolute truth that no one could avoid.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hiih……ugwa……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A wordless cream was leaking out from Benalith’s mouth like a sob.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He didn’t want to die. To avoid death he would even kowtow and beg for his life without any shame.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      That’s why, I’m begging you, please don’t kill me.
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Against the death god that no one could oppose, humans could only pray and beg for forgiveness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Benalith unconsciously shed tears that came out like flood from his eyes and prayed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Let’s not go further than that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The wordless pressure towards Benality was cut off together with Ignis’s voice.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Benalith lost his strength and limply fell on his knees when the invisible pressure was suddenly gone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You can go back, quickly while you still haven’t angered my wife further than this.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Y-y-y-yess!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Why was Maggot angry? Why did he have to be bathed in killing intent like this? Benalith didn’t even have the leeway to feel such doubt.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He only wished to get away from the death god in front of him even just a second faster. Benality didn’t even send a backward glance and desperately ran towards the entrance with only that single thought in mind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Sorry, but today I have no intention to let this end with only venting my stress.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wasn’t like Maggot couldn’t guess what Welkin was thinking. Depending on how she thought about it, she could also feel pride that the king was expecting so much from her son.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the previous war, there was the precedent when Welkin was selecting the young Harold who was his close aide to be the prime minister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     With this chance, Baldr could even become a candidate to be the prime minister in the future. Surely some people thought that they should rejoice for that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Maggot didn’t give a damn about such things.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No, it was more than that, she even felt unpleasant feelings in her guts toward the royal court for pushing such expectation on her son.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the world, just because something was correct politically didn’t mean that everything would be forgiven.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If those people in the palace didn’t understand that, it was Maggot’s style to teach them directly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even with Ignis’s martial skill, he was unable to stop Maggot by himself, not when she was already this determined.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he seriously wanted to stop Maggot, he had to mobilize all the elites under his command like Zirco and ready himself to sacrifice more than half of them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis opened his mouth with a certain determination in his heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「His majesty’s deed this time, it’s not like I myself can completely agree with it……but the biggest problem lies in another place.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Well now, what could it be that Ignis was referring to? Maggot unintentionally forgot her anger and tilted her head at Ignis’s words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What you’re actually feeling is that you’re lonely because Baldr is gone, isn’t it? Don’t you think that we need to have another child soon?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa-?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The attack that came from a completely unexpected direction made Maggot’s face reddened. She was so flustered that her mouth was opening and closing wordlessly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Though she looked like this, Maggot was a person with deep emotion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the past, she was also looking after her handicapped son to an overprotective degree because his mind was in a chaotic state due to his past memories. Such a thing wouldn’t be possible without a deep love for her son.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For such a woman to be parted from her son for this long, certainly she might need a second child to compensate.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If possible she wanted a girl as her second child──it was a fact that there was such a wish inside Maggot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Y-you can’t distract me with such things, Ignis! I’m seriously angry here!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I swear upon my words, I’m not saying this with the intention to distract you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Ignis said that, his hands were already holding Maggot’s slim waist firmly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis was fully deploying all his skills in coquetry as a playboy whose name once resounded all over the royal capital Cameron.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His wiles that easily mellowed down that Silver Light Maggot when she was in a fit of anger shocked Zirco so greatly that her feelings went beyond mere surprise and she was moved to tears.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Amazing! Count! You’re a real man!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis pulled the resisting Maggot into his embrace and passionately whispered into the ear of the blushing Maggot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Baldr will also soon become an adult. Is it selfish of me for wishing that the two of us can go back to that time when there were only the two of us loving one another?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uuu……b-but I’m already getting on in years……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You haven’t changed at all from that time when you stole my heart with a single glance──even now you are my only goddess.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis lifted up Maggot’s slender chin and stole her lips while her mind was still in chaos to finish her off.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Nnnn–」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The sensation of the lips melted her. Maggot was aware that a sweet haze was filling her head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She wondered when was the last time they exchanged a kiss this passionate.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (N-no good. This isn’t the time to do something like this……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot’s little remaining rational mind tried to somehow maintain her anger that was melted by this pink atmosphere, but even that was nothing more than a wasted effort.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hiyaa!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Just when she thought that Ignis finally let go of her lips, his lips nibbled on Maggot’s soft lips and his right hand gently caressed her back.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even with his eyes closed, Ignis was thoroughly familiar with the weak spot in Maggot’s body.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot’s hands went around Ignis’s neck as though to admit that she couldn’t endure the heightening stimulation anymore.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll let you deceive me this time only! Even so I’ll make you pay for this debt in full!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Of course, I shall love you with everything I have.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot femininely buried her face onto Ignis’s chest. She wasn’t just awkward, she actually was also a simple woman.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 6
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Around a week after that conversation between the Cornelius couple, something strange happened in the palace.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Welkin woke up from his sleep, unbelievably there was the word 「Bald」 written on his forehead in big letters using something like ink.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His concubine who attended to him at night and the maid who cleaned up afterwards testified that there was no such word on his face until he went to bed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Then who in the world was able to do something like this?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The number of royal guards guarding the bedroom was immediately increased. He also chose a skilled former female knight to be the one attending him at night.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However the next day, the word 「Bald」 was engraved on the king’s forehead with even bigger and clearer letters than yesterday.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As expected, even the bold Welkin came to fear the situation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If it was against a visible threat, he wouldn’t feel any fear and could even feel delight in taking revenge, but the fact that someone whose identity and objective he didn’t know was holding his life in their hand was making his blood run cold.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Yes, if they felt like it, the person who was doing this prank could kill Welkin anytime.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He mobilized more than fifty knights to surround the king’s bedroom. With this security, not even an ant could crawl in. And yet the result didn’t change.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Welkin’s cheeks had thinned greatly within only three days. There were also dark circles under his eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He didn’t have the slightest idea of what to do to defend against this prank.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Welkin was Welkin because he didn’t just curl in fear even in this situation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Welkin resolved that tonight he wouldn’t sleep and ascertain the criminal.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He turned on the lamps brightly and sat cross-legged on the bed to wait for the entrance of this hateful criminal. Perhaps his life would be in danger if he rashly encountered the criminal while awake, but he didn’t care about that anymore.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He simply wished to ascertain the identity of the criminal who had taken away his peaceful sleep.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The night was gradually growing late without him even taking a nap and then the sun was rising.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Welkin gulped a cup of black tea and rubbed his eyes. He saw the light of morning sun leaking from between the curtains.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed that morning had come before he realized it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Hmph, so they got cold feet! They don’t dare to show up while I’m awake!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Welkin was aghast when he saw his face in the mirror when he was going to wash his face to keep himself awake.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The word 「Bald」 was evidently written in very big letters on Welkin’s forehead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was sure that he never fell asleep for even a wink.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The fact that the word was written on his face while he was awake without him even realizing it made Welkin faint backward on the spot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──It was unclear what chain of events happened after that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the fact remained that after that Welkin handed a great amount of support money to Baldr who was heading to Antrim. He would also send an official letter to Cornelius House beforehand when there was a matter that concerned Baldr’s treatment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 7
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Now then, I have settled the debt. Now I’ll have you take responsibility for your words.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot pushed down Ignis’s body on the bed with eyes that were glistening with animalistic lust.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In recent years Maggot had completely abstained from this act because her motherhood was too strong, but before Baldr was born, Maggot was an extremely avaricious woman in the bedroom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis grimly hardened his determination while wondering how far he could satisfy Maggot now that he had lost his youth.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Now that it had come to this, Maggot must be seriously planning to squeeze him dry until she got pregnant.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Would Maggot’s pregnancy come first, or would he dry up first? This was a battle with his life on the line.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I’m sorry Baldr……Tou-san……might not be able to meet you alive anymore.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In this world, Ignis was the only one who knew that Maggot was actually more terrifying and formidable when going wild on the bed rather than when encountering her in a battlefield.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m not going to let you sleep until morning tonight.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Haha……please go easy on me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Baldr. For a man……for a man, there is time when they have to fight even if they know they will loseeeee!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 8
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was grumbling about his own misfortune in the capital without even knowing how his father was risking his life to hold back his mother.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m just a trainee who hasn’t even graduated from the knight academy. I haven’t even started learning how to manage a count house……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I too am completely agreeing with you in regards to that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The knight academy’s headmaster, Ramillies, tapped Baldr’s shoulder with pity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To be honest Baldr was already going through hardships that were dozens of times greater than a normal person simply from being born as Maggot’s son, and yet now he even had Mauricia’s appendicitis forced on him. Ramillies pitied him so much he couldn’t even say anything.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll lend you a hand if it’s something that I can do. Also, I’ll make it so that you’re treated like a graduate of this academy.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If possible, can the headmaster also make Brooks and several other people who wish for it to receive graduation qualifications? At present I don’t have any vassals of my own.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m astonished once more by his majesty’s order this time……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr didn’t even have any retainers that he could use as bureaucrats in his ruling. He wondered just what was the king trying to make this boy do?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was also like this when the king selected Harold to be the prime minister. That king loved people with talent, at the same time he also had the tendency to purposefully put them through trials.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Fortunately, there was a directive from the king to recruit applicants from among the existing government in Antrim and left behind the minimum number of people to keep the government functioning.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was very unusual for that king to do this kind of follow up.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the magistrate himself who was the top leader of the administration there wanted to leave Antrim no matter what. Certainly it was a place that could become a battlefield anytime. Not only the magistrate, the bureaucrats who were dispatched from the capital wouldn’t want to live there for long.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Is it okay that you leave Silk behind?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No no, as expected there is no way I can bring along the daughter of Randolph House with me!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr denied it as though he had heard something outrageous. Ramillies shrugged lightly at how dense Baldr was and laughed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    From Ramillies’s observation, if Baldr went to Antrim like this without saying anything, that
    <ruby>
     young lady
     <rt>
      Silk
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    would undoubtedly get angry.
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This might be meddlesome of him, but it seemed there was a need for Ramillies to make some effort.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Besides, if Baldr could obtain the support from Randolph House, it should become a great political benefit for Baldr too.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although Ramillies had already stepped back from the frontline, he was well aware that the royal capital was infested by riffraff that wouldn’t be happy if some noble in a remote region prospered and wouldn’t hesitate to act as hindrance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──It’s not to my liking to push hardships on the young people though.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although he was involved with politics as a military officer, as an old soldier who was unable to take care of the old problems and had to bequeath those problems to the next generation to be taken care of, there was something that he still had to do before he closed the curtain of his life.

    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 9
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I don’t like you, but this time only I’m feeling pity for you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford Randolf drank up a glass of amber liquid with ice clinking inside it before he stared at Baldr with pity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     All men who could possibly take his daughter away from him were enemies, but if he didn’t take that into consideration, Baldr was someone that Alford could evaluate highly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rather it was fine to say that Baldr had greatly contributed to the expansion of Randolf House’s political influence.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If only Baldr hadn’t gotten so close to Silk, then even Alford would be thankful to him and have great expectations from him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Thank you very much for your excellency’s kind words, but more than that, there is something that I urgently required.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Naturally. You’re at an age where originally you shouldn’t even need any court rank. And, what is it that you need?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For a noble son, it was already good if they started aiding their father in managing the territory when they were fifteen years old. Most people would only study diligently under a teacher at best.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But Baldr already had his own personal assets, and he even possessed the source of funds and sales network to supplement for that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In addition, with his recent success in international relationships, the market for his product and connections were reaching until other countries. It was really an out of the norm development.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As a viscount, Baldr had managed to be counted as a first class noble. He also had the backing of the king and Randolph House. In his current position, there weren’t many things that were out of his reach. One of those things was──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Can your excellency recommend to me an administrative official who can be trusted and is also experienced in practical duty?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Of course you will ask that. I thought that’s the case but……that is an unreasonable demand.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m aware.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What Baldr was decisively lacking in were retainers who he could trust.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he relied on Savaran Company’s intermediation, he might be able to find some people who were good with accounting.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, there were many illogical parts in managing a territory, so it would be difficult to completely entrust this task to such people who were operating based on profit.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When managing a territory, there were times when for the sake of the country or for the sake of the territory, the lord had to extort the people with a heavy tax until they didn’t have a single penny left, or perhaps they would have to be frugal with money even if it was so painful like their legs were lit on fire, or perhaps the lord had to keep spending money even if his doing that would put his house in the red.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If there was a mistake in making adjustments on such matters, the population in the territory could be ruined even if the lord’s house was prospering, or perhaps the territory could be prospering while the country’s benefit was harmed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was why there was no guarantee that someone who was an excellent merchant could become an excellent politician.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There is no way that it will be that easy to find such convenient talent──is what I want to say, but actually I know someone who fits the bill.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr opened his eyes wide in surprise. Alford grinned in delight seeing his surprise.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m talking about a girl who served as Silk’s private tutor in the past. Her name is Agatha Mileton(アガサ・マイルトン), the second daughter of Baronet Mileton House. She is renowned as a talented woman and even Silk is emotionally attached to her. When she returned back to her home, she was the one who was practically managing the financial affairs of Mileton House by herself.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Will it be alright if I recruited such person?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr asked a very natural question. It didn’t matter how talented she was, it would be meaningless if she didn’t want to come with him to Antrim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Actually, the headship of Mileton House had been taken over last year. The eldest son Hayne(ヘイン) succeeded the house, but his relationship with Miss Agatha is bad and he took away all the authority from her. As a result, Mileton House’s financial condition is visibly worsening. Of course all the problems will be resolved if Miss Agatha returns home but……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「His pride gets in the way and he doesn’t want to recognize his fault, is that it?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It doesn’t stop there, it seems he tried to drive out Miss Agatha by offering her to the old Count Chester to be his second wife as a debt collateral. Because of that, she washed her hands of him and cut ties with Mileton House. Currently she is staying in this house.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     So that was how it was. To hire a woman who was in such a situation would mean turning Baronet Mileton into an enemy. Any noble would hesitate to accept her unless it was a powerful family like the Randolph House or a cornered noble like Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「She has been slightly getting on in years, but I don’t mind if you take her as your wife you know? No, rather you should do just that. And then you can be hated by Silk. After all, that girl looks up to Miss Agatha like her big sister.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You’re still like usual, your excellency. Don’t say I didn’t warn your excellency if she resents you because she married late.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Just be aware that I’ll never send Silk to a remote place like Antrim. You too, lord, it’ll be better if you quickly marry her highness Rachel and settle down.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Otou-sama, what do you mean by that!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed Silk was standing outside the door. She hurriedly opened the door and rushed into the room.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was wearing an eye-catching deep blue dress and a black garnet hair ornaments on her golden hair.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even for Baldr, this might be his first time seeing Silk dressing herself up to this degree.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Why did Otou-sama mention the name of Rachel-sama in the conversation just now? Originally, she should become the queen of Sanjuan Kingdom, right?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Calm down, Ojou-sama. A lady mustn’t get that flustered so easily.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A petite woman stepped forward from besides Silk. She gently patted the back of Silk who was shaking in bewilderment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was shorter than even Seyruun, but her intelligent and strong-willed blue eyes along with her slightly thick lips were standing out.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From the flow of the conversation, this person was most likely Agatha Mileton.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Pardon my impoliteness. It’s good to see you safe and sound, Baldr.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Long time no see too, Silk. I was shocked because you looked too pretty.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s praise of Silk’s attire came from his heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Silk’s appearance after seriously dressing up herself as the young lady of a great noble was filled with grace and elegance that weren’t at all inferior against even the royal family.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s great, isn’t it, Silk.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Silk’s face reddened like a boiled octopus at the suggestive words into her ear and she yelled.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Agatha-oneesama, please don’t make fun of me!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was clearly shaken from shyness. It made Alford reconfirm Baldr’s existence as his enemy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To repeat, it didn’t matter how capable the man was or how bright his future would be, that man would be his enemy if there was a possibility of that man stealing Silk from him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Take Miss Agatha with you already and get out, you enemy of women.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Marquis-sama, you will be hated by Ojou-sama if you are acting like that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Just as Agatha said, Silk was glaring at him angrily with tearful eyes. Alford easily changed his attitude like flipping his hand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all, with how things went, things would go just like the king planned and Baldr would marry Princess Rachel anyways in the end. At that time Baldr would be separated from his daughter.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It didn’t matter how much he rose in rank. As expected there was no way Baldr would be able to have a princess as his legal wife and still have a marquis’s only daughter as his concubine.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    「──Let me introduce her once more. This is Miss Agatha Mileton who I mentioned to you just now. She is a great woman who has the capability of controlling the entire management of her house’s territory smoothly if only
    <ruby>
     that idiot
     <rt>
      Hayne
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    wasn’t stubborn.」
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It’s an honor to meet you Viscount Baldr-sama, I have heard about your rumor from Ojou-sama.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha smiled elegantly and bowed with her hands lifting up her skirt slightly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She had an extremely beautiful expression, but her smile didn’t reach her eyes, which were measuring Baldr. It gave him an unbalanced impression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr didn’t hate this kind of woman, but many nobles with high pride who sought for feminine modesty in women might dislike her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There are a lot of things that I wished to ask but……first Marquis-sama, can I ask for an explanation regarding the matter of her highness Rachel first? This will be for the sake of Ojou-sama’s curiosity too.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I also want to know about it too.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha and Silk turned their gaze back at Alford.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford who was suddenly put under the gaze of three people couldn’t help but feel complicated once more at the influence that Baldr had.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he made his decision not as Silk’s father but as the head of Randolph House, then perhaps Baldr would be someone that he wanted to obtain as an ally no matter what.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If his feelings that didn’t want to hand over his daughter were taken out of the equation, there was a part of him which was thinking that the crafty king had pulled one over on him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Regardless of whether Baldr wished for it or not, there was a high possibility that a turmoil would occur in the future with Baldr at the center. There was no doubting that Welkin considered it a rare opportunity that he could use.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was still less than fifteen years old. Originally at his age he should be accumulating experience by observing and learning as the heir of a count house. The burden that was put on him was heavy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──No, it was too heavy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even when he tried calculating the advantage and disadvantages for Randolph House in the future, this boy called Baldr might be a dangerous character as a greatly uncertain factor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……This is just a rumor in the royal court and nothing definite. It’s nothing but my own speculation. So keep that in mind while listening to me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The information that Alford told them wasn’t that much.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     First was that Rachel’s marriage into Sanjuan Kingdom’s royal family was broken off. There was also a marriage talk from Nedras(ネドラス) Dukedom, but Welkin rejected it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The other information was that Baldr was invited by Rachel to a tea party in the palace after he returned from Sanjuan Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Silk heard the part where the princess and Baldr were having fun talking with each other, Silk sent a protesting gaze with tearful eyes at Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The finishing blow was the appointment of Baldr as Viscount Antrim this time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Thinking normally, this appointment would be more like a punishment. Even the nobles who were Baldr’s opposition could be heard pitying this appointment of his among their ridicules toward him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To put it another way, it could also be said that the only way Baldr could be promoted in rank without getting criticized by the other nobles was this method.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even with the great result that Baldr obtained from his negotiation with Sanjuan Kingdom, it would be natural for various oppositions to rise if Baldr was promoted and given a territory with just that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was exactly because the territory that was given to him was a remote region located at the frontlines where no one wanted to go that Baldr’s advancement was overlooked as a funny story.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But in case Baldr raised another great achievement in that remote region that anybody would have to recognize──naturally his next reward would be the rank of count.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Taking into consideration that Baldr would succeed Cornelius House in the future, it also wouldn’t be strange if he got promoted to be a new margrave.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That would be the birth of a groom with status that compared very favorably with the princess.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It didn’t seem like anyone had even noticed such a possibility. In a strategic sense, Alford got a chill when thinking about Welkin’s political sense for selecting Baldr as Viscount Antrim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore, that scheming king wasn’t satisfied with just that. He was even aiming to do a reformation with this too. It would be like killing two birds with one stone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was the true worth of that sly fox who was too old to be caught in any trap.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Because of that I’m thinking that old fox is planning to take you into the royal family. It’s an absurd story if we consider your age and also your court rank. Properly speaking that is. But that king is a man who can go that far without batting an eyelid. And you too……seeing how you are a troublemaker who is running away from a peaceful life, this prediction of mine shouldn’t be that far off the mark.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What a complete nuisance the king is.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha muttered with an exasperated voice and leaned deeply on the back of her chair.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s just as you say.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr nodded as though he had gotten a friend who really understood him well, but Agatha then struck without any mercy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──You’re also the same.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uguh.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was really a bothersome story.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A whimsical and scheming but also capable lord, and a young hero who was born with a stormy fate accompanying him. This situation came from such a miraculous encounter that might not happen even once in ten thousand years.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This wasn’t a coincidence by any means. Agatha knew as a knowledge that this kind of coincidence, no, inevitability that looked like a miracle was something that happened when history was moving.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And Silk was attracted to such a man of all people. Should her eyes be praised for their accuracy, or should they be lamented for their misfortune…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……That’s horrible! That’s like Baldr is just a political tool! Besides, what does his majesty think the princess is!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Silk was enraged and yelled after she finished listening to Alford’s words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But Alford who was her blood-related father understood from a glance that her anger didn’t come from logic but from emotion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no way Silk who was born in Randolph House, one of the ten great nobles, couldn’t understand a political strategy of that level.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The king thinks that this boy has that much value. Personally, I think his majesty is overestimating him though.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If a margrave who was also the king’s son-in-law was born, he might replace one of the ten great nobles depending on the situation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore, although it annoyed him something fierce to admit it, Alford acknowledged Welkin’s skill as a politician.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Not just that, for Alford who was having problems with Trystovy Dukedom, Welkin was an ally that he couldn’t go without.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then Otou-sama is saying that you’re agreeing with his majesty’s plan?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How can a retainer speak anything impertinent regarding a royalty’s marriage. Besides, my instinct is telling me that her highness Rachel isn’t that opposed to this arrangement.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I hate someone like Otou-sama!!!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Silk ran out of the room without even looking back.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford who didn’t learn from his past experience and got hit by his daughter’s counterattack that surpassed his expectation turned into a pillar of salt and crumbled.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter how many times they experienced it, there was no father who would get used to their daughter telling them 「I hate you」.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Is it okay to not chase after her?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha made a mean smile and looked at Baldr while saying that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……What will be a good answer for this kind of time, I wonder?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Baldr was allowed to speak conceitedly, he had to say that Silk was harboring affection towards him as a member of the opposite sex.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, as the only child of Count Cornelius, there was no option for him to take her as his wife.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Baldr married into Randolph House, Cornelius House could also adopt someone else to be the heir, but there was no way that Ignis and Maggot would allow such a thing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha narrowed her eyes at Baldr’s unexpected childish reaction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr had the option to comfort Silk even if he had to lie, or keep her away at a distance by using the matter with the princess as an excuse.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr didn’t choose either of them in indecision. The appearance of a hero who was shouldering the future of the kingdom couldn’t be seen from him at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      Well, fortunately it seems that there is still a little hope for Ojou-sama.
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha formed her words with a cheerful face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「For now you should make your feelings clear even if it’s only inside your heart. Even if it’s a romance with a great obstacle standing in the way, you should have the strength to make it a reality no matter what, my lord.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Meanwhile, Silk rushed into her room without even wiping the tear that was trickling along her cheek. She finally noticed her own feelings of love and her calculating mind as a noble that had been ingrained into her without her even noticing about it. A sob leaked out from her throat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……I’m, a disgusting woman……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was able to honestly give her congratulations to Seyruun and Selina when they were proposed by Baldr, and yet she was shaken to this degree when she heard about the marriage talk of Princess Rachel.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was because in the first case, she had the calculation that the seat of Baldr’s legal wife was still empty.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two girls who were commoners with low vanity wouldn’t fit as the legal wife of a viscount house.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was a part of her that unconsciously concluded like that. It made her think of herself as an unbearably ugly creature.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though she thought of the two of them as friends.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though they were friends of similar age like her, she could talk openly without any reserve that she had wished for so long.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Somewhere in her heart, she was looking down on them and immersing herself in a feeling of superiority that in the end they would only be concubines.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps it was a divine punishment for her that Princess Rachel who had higher social status than her appeared as a candidate to be Baldr’s wife.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She should just give up everything because of the feeling of guilt and she wouldn’t need to feel this suffering, and yet──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Stupid……why is it only after this late……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter how hard she thought, she couldn’t see a future where the two of them could marry. Even so she had fallen in love with Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No, she had been in love with him long before this to a maddening degree.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was just scared to become aware of that until now and continued to avoid that fact.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, now that she had become aware like this, she couldn’t find any answer of what she should do.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The Silk who was a marquis’s daughter shook her head in negative.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The answer was already obvious. She should quickly give up on Baldr and forget him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, she didn’t want to give up.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──She didn’t want to hand Baldr over to Rachel.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Someone……help-……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The sobbing of Silk who was tormented by a wish that couldn’t be granted never ceased until the night grew late.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 10
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The horse carriage that Baldr and his companions were riding was heading straight towards Cornelius.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr graduated from the knight academy in a hurry, but he was only able to recruit Brooks and Nelson from among his school friends as his vassals.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then there was Agatha who moved from Randolph House to become Antrim House’s head secretary and a total of three accountants that Savaran Company introduced to him. These six people were all of Baldr’s vassals at the present time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although there were also the kingdom’s bureaucrats in Antrim territory who were still remaining there in not a small number. There was also a plan for Cornelius House to send him some support.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course Baldr didn’t have the slightest doubt that his past friends in Cornelius territory starting from Tyros would help him out.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「However……why did it turn out like this……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When it was decided that he would leave his birthplace and enroll into the royal knight academy, his dream ran wild with the thoughts of having new encounters and doing business in the capital. But now it felt like something that had happened a long time ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What kind of mistake happened that now he became a lord viscount with his own territory like this?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though he still wanted to play around childishly befitting as a student for just a while more. If possible, he also wanted to experience making one or two bittersweet memories while he was at it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And yet he skipped such a process by leaping over three steps of it and became someone with two fiancées and employing vassals. No one could possibly imagine that things would turn out like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ah! I can see it! Baldr-sama」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun had stopped calling him young master now. She was leaning out from the carriage and smiling.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
<img src="img/056.jpg"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She too had tasted a drastic change in her life. She fell in love with the young boy who she thought of as a little brother all this time and also was proposed to despite the difference in status between the two. After going through all that, she felt deeply moved to see her birthplace that was still unchanging like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The one waiting for them at the other side of the familiar green deep forest wasn’t Maggot or even Tyros.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「O~~~~i! Chieffffffffff!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The very first one who appeared to welcome them with her big body shaking on top of a horse was Zirco.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In Baldr’s memory, she should be slightly fat due to the bad result of eating delicious food too lavishly, but her waist and stomach were very slender with her cheeks having lost all fat. Perhaps she had done her best with moderating her eating.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As expected a pro mercenary was really different. Baldr renewed his evaluation toward Zirco.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However that only lasted for a brief moment──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I wanted to meet youuu! Chiefffffffff!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Dowaah!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco launched a diving body press attack as though to crush Baldr underneath. Baldr screamed in shock.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Lately Baldr had grown remarkably, but as expected his size was too small to catch Zirco’s large body.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s horrible. You know, even though big sis didn’t stop the other guys from going out as helpers, she makes me always stay behind as her sparring partner. I don’t know when my body is going to break at this rate……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Enough for now, get off!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He barely prevented Seyruun from getting pressed down too by using body strengthening, but he was still buried under Zirco’s huge body, so Baldr ordered her shortly to get off him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ‘Heave ho, heave ho’, Seyruun tried hard to pull Zirco off of Baldr, but Zirco’s body weight wasn’t something she could do anything about with her slender arms.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr felt healed seeing Seyruun looking like a kid dealing with a toy that she couldn’t lift up. But even during this time, the hugging of Zirco’s arms was gradually getting stronger.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m begging you, just let me go already. I’ll do anything! This time I’ll absolutely come along with you to Antrim!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Just what in the world has happened?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Big sis is bullying me……it was so painful it felt like I’d die, but she would stop when I was just barely at my limit. She was a person just like chief said, a pure sadist!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco fervently talked about the cruel days she went through after parting with Baldr. Her large body was shaking like a child’s all along.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her story was just so pitiful that even Seyruun couldn’t help but allow Zirco to keep hugging Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aa……there there. I was also planning to ask Zirco to help with defending Antrim……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ueeeh! Really? It’s a promise, okay?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      Is it really okay to act like this, veteran mercenary-san?
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Such thoughts crossed Baldr’s mind, but as someone who knew the best just how mentally and physically exhausting it was to spend every day under the abnormal threat of his mother, he could only feel sympathy for Zirco from the bottom of his heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the first place, he was still lacking in manpower for governing Antrim no matter how many people he recruited.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco who had her personal connection with the mercenaries would be an extremely useful recruit for building a defense structure with prompt efficiency.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「When big sis learned that chief is appointed as Viscount Antrim……it was scarryyy. She was also scary when chief was sent to Sanjuan Kingdom, but it was only this time that I thought it’s over already for Mauricia Kingdom.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m amazed that person could just stay quiet after that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Welkin’s impossible task was still within the tolerable limit for Baldr, but against an uncontrollable inhuman person like Maggot, giving such a task was something akin to making the worst move.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr believed that his father wouldn’t overlook his mother’s running wild, even so he was secretly worrying that perhaps his mother would be too much for his father this time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If she felt like it, that mother could easily kill even the king.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If his mother chose the path of an assassin instead of a mercenary, around this time the kings in the continent would be unable to do their activity without a body double taking their place.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was like the word untouchable existed for Maggot’s sake.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco had finally calmed down. Together with her, the horse carriage went towards the mansion. There Baldr heard unexpected news on the way and felt surprised.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──I thought I was going to die. Though I couldn’t possibly stop big sis even if I tried at the risk of my life. To be honest, I now see the count in a more positive light.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Why are you mentioning father there?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even big sis is weak against the man she was in love with──that’s what I mean. To stop big sis by bulldozing her with love, even the gods won’t think of such idea.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr thought of his father as a completely whipped husband, but it seemed he was a man who would pull through when push came to shove.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although the story that her mother was getting bulldozed by love and became obedient was also something that Baldr couldn’t imagine at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When they entered Cornelius’s street, his nostalgic friends who he spent childhood together with, Tyros, Porco, Margo, and the others were lining up on the main street that was made from stone, waiting for Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Tyros had grown and became increasingly taller. His eyes were moist due to his max loyalty that was still like always.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aa, Baldr-sama……! You have grown to be a splendid personage……!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Long time no see, Tyros. You have grown even bigger.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Each moment seem like an eternity while I was waiting for this day to come!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Tyros had a dream of serving on Baldr’s side one day and never being negligent in his zeal.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In martial art, he wasn’t a match against a knight, but Tyros had a rare talent to comprehend Baldr’s intention and practiced it organizationally.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was an absolutely necessary manpower in Baldr’s management of Antrim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Come to think of it, I heard that Margo had married.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yep, with Corin of the shoe store. It’s regretful that I won’t be able to follow young master though.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You don’t need to mind that, congratulations.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wasn’t just him, people couldn’t avoid changing together with the passing of time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His comrades who made sugar together those days had grown into adults and walked their own path. It was something he felt happy but also lonely about.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll come along you know? Okaa-san is still opposing it, but Otou-san is giving me his permission.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Porco who was slightly fat had grown a lot into a proportional body that looked really manly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Surely he would become a good guard just like his father.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Thank you. I’m happy to know that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr felt a heavy responsibility weighing on him at the same time when he said that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all, depending on the situation, Antrim might become a deathly warzone on the frontlines.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr and others enjoyed their reunion with their long-time friends for a while, and then after that they passed the main street and headed to Cornelius Castle that had a large castle gate and spires meant for lookout.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What’s going on?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Dozens of fully-armed guards along with maids and butlers were all lining up orderly with their heads bowed his way.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The excessively bombastic welcoming made Baldr and Seyruun look at each other.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, setting aside the matter of Baldr’s Antrim territory that was in poor condition, Baldr had received the rank of viscount on paper and now he could be counted as a first-class noble. On top of that he also had saved a princess and also acted as the key figure who spearheaded an alliance with a neighboring country.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This welcoming could be said as conservative instead, considering Baldr’s achievement and status right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This stupid son, you finally returned home. Looks like you have been making eyes at other women just like your father in the past.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I missed you Baldr, you must never get distracted by other women and ignore your mama here!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot hadn’t changed at all. She was laughing haughtily with her canines bared.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──By the way, where is Tou-san?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr couldn’t see his father anywhere even though that father was someone who wanted to look cool in front of his son. Baldr tilted his head and asked Maggot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「A, aa……right now that guy is recuperating because he hurt his waist.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His mother’s words were unusually evasive. It strengthened Baldr’s suspicion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot’s style at this kind of time should be to whip Ignis even more without caring of his injuries.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Could it be that his father was seriously wounded in order to stop his mother from running wild?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then, I have to go visit Tou-san quickly……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though he had left for quite a long time, this was the house where he was born and raised. Baldr started walking towards his father’s private room that he knew the location well, but someone lightly pulled at his sleeve.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was Agatha.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「My lord, please give us your order.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Baldr and Seyruun, this place was their own house. But for Agatha, Brooks, and the others, Cornelius House was nothing more than another house that their master was connected with.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr carelessly forgot to be considerate to his vassals. He scratched his head awkwardly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He would be the lord at Antrim where he had to be responsible, and yet it seemed he was still lacking in awareness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You’re bringing someone unusual here……so who is this?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s an honor to be in your presence. My name is Agatha Mileton. I will be serving as my lord’s head secretary.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha didn’t show even the slightest timidity against Maggot’s silent pressure and bowed her head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They both were strong-minded women of character, although of different types.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps women of character could easily recognize other women of character. Maggot unexpectedly held a good impression toward Agatha and held her hand toward her with a delighted smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll leave my son in your hands. This kid looks like someone intelligent, but at heart he is still a brat.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Agatha was bewildered by this reaction from Maggot, but as to be expected from a strong-minded woman who once managed a noble house.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She confidently grasped that hand back and smiled graciously.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This incompetent self shall give its all.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Speaking of Mileton House, it’s a baronet house in the north, isn’t it? You seem a better prospect to be a wife rather than the likes of a princess who only has her status going for her.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No……I have no intention to be ungrateful to the young lady of Randolph House.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha’s statement was implicitly disclosing the relationship between Silk and Baldr. Baldr felt like the space cracked with a snap after that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aahn?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Glare*His mother’s eyes turned dangerous as though she was looking at trash. A chill ran through Baldr’s back when he saw that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Baldr-sama, you idiot……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun also guessed what was going on and pouted with a sulky look while pinching Baldr’s side.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「N-no, I’m innocent
    </span>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      you know? What could be they talking about
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ……?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr who was exposed to the gazes of the women that were as sharp as needles tried to go through this by averting his gaze away, but of course there was no way his effort could work.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Good timing. I guess I should check whether your skill has dulled or not after drowning yourself in women like this……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s effort ended in vain. Maggot called for a butler with a smirk and ordered him briefly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Guide the guests to the guest rooms, politely.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please leave it to me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Now then, my son, are you prepared?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s gaze moved toward Agatha looking for help, but she curtly abandoned him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then please pardon us for now, my lord, please enjoy your time to your heart’s content.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You should help your master here!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please give up. I wish to avoid the madam for seeing me as a wife candidate even more than this.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Could it be Agatha, you actually hate me……?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For some reason Agatha smiled widely and bowed deeply toward Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s absurd. I respect you, my lord, from the bottom of my heart, but in the end it’s only as an employer.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Your wording! That means you hate me as a man isn’t it?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I never said that from my mouth.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha kept smiling in amusement and averted her gaze intentionally.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed Agatha was similar to his mother even in the sadistic aspect.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You have resolved yourself, haven’t you? A man who doesn’t know when to give up won’t be liked.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Go easy on me……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco had curled into herself without anyone noticing to hide her large body from the two’s gazes. She renewed her loyalty toward Baldr who had become an honorable sacrifice.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all, if it was Ignis here right now, he would undoubtedly round her up to get embroiled into the beat up too.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Chief……you are the greatest man there is! I’m saved with this!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco ran her mouth with words that would make Baldr greatly enraged if he heard it. She was finally feeling relieved from the bottom of her heart at the peace that had arrived.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No, I’ll report it that you were saying that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Brooks gave a warning with an exasperated face. It went without saying what happened to Zirco later.
    </span>

    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 11
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Kuh……it has been a long time since I thought I’m going to die……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A match with Maggot was extremely gruesome like usual.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr believed that he had also grown greatly since he left the house, but he still wasn’t a match for Maggot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was toyed with to her heart’s content and his desperate counterattacks all failed to reach her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Was this mother really a human?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Are you saying something?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No, nothing.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He couldn’t be careless when speaking.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After finishing their physical talk, Maggot and Baldr immediately went to visit the recuperating Ignis.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr endured the dull pain that was tormenting his whole body and knocked on Ignis’s door lightly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m coming in, Tou-san.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yeah, I’ve been waiting for you Baldr.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What was waiting for Baldr inside the room was the completely changed figure of his father who was smiling faintly while sitting up on the bed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis’s face that was illuminated by the sunlight from the window was gaunt with a bad complexion. His skin was also looking shriveled.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, even though he was having the appearance of a sickly person at death’s door, his expression was refreshed like a man who had accomplished something. Baldr sensed the greatness of his father who managed to stop his mother.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Similar to Baldr, Ignis was also perceiving the growth of his son from the scratches all over Baldr’s pretty face and his body under his clothes that must be covered all over with bruises.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Tou-san!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「My son!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two of them moved to hug each other almost at the same time and patted each other’s back for encouragement.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no need for words here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They instinctively understood what each other had overcome and accomplished.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Now was exactly the time for men to comprehend each other.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──You two, have you two eaten something bad?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot stared at them with a weirded out look toward the father-son embrace that a woman couldn’t understand. Then she sat down heavily on a chair.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     While hugging each other, Baldr could feel with his skin Ignis’s thinned flesh.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Fortunately, it seemed that Ignis’s muscles that were indispensable for a military man didn’t look like they had withered.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rather it was like his excess flesh had been removed, or more like any excess energy like the fats that the body was piling up had been thoroughly snatched away.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Was his body reduced into this state after solely focusing on holding back a rampaging Maggot?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Now that he thought about it, Zirco was saying something like 「Stopping mother by bulldozing her with love」 wasn’t she…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Tou-san, just what kind of rashness did you do?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「U……umu. I too am not as young as I used too, something like that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Haa?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was seriously puzzled by Ignis’s sudden words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis obviously wasn’t young anymore at his age that was nearing forty.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Certainly him hurting his waist was like a symptom of an elderly, but whether his waist was hurt or his bone was broken, it was already a wonderful result that he could keep his life seeing that his opponent was Maggot. Baldr knew that better than anyone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot answered in the place of Ignis who didn’t know what to say. She too was unusually blushing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I think you must have known too but……Antrim is a land of death that is easy to be attacked but hard to defend. Even so as that place’s feudal lord, protecting it with your life is where you can show your worth as a man.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Of course I have resolved myself to protect that territory.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was also preparing various plans to deal with that problem too. Unlike before, the things he could do had increased because as the lord of the land he didn’t need to hold back anymore.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr believed that he had enough prospects for success.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph, sorry but we too don’t have the leeway to wait forever until our unfaithful son comes home……we have a new heir on the way, so feel free to die or to live as you please.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Baldr will also become a big brother next year. We still don’t know whether it will be a brother or sister but, do your best as a big bro okay!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As expected even Ignis was at his wits’ end at how awkward his wife was at this time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Baldr’s eyes snapped open and he yelled in shock without caring about such a thing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Kaa-san is pregnant!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Y-yeah……fortunately I managed it before I ran out of stamina.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis answered weakly, but Baldr didn’t even look at him and pressed his questions on Maggot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Kaa-san! Why are you dressing that lightly even though you have a child in your stomach!? Also doing something like spear training is just out of question!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot who was pressed by Baldr with a threatening aura that he never directed toward her until now made her mouth twitch and she argued.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No, but……you know, a moderate exercise is still necessary so……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What are you going to do if the worst happens from us crossing spears! From now on combat training is forbidden! Riding horses and hunting is also forbidden!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「W-wait. Then my hobbies to vent out my stress are……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot was pressed back by her son’s pressure for the first time. Although she was bewildered, she tried to at least secure a chance for training.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Who are you going to protect if you can’t even protect the child inside you as a mother! Don’t you love the child who will be born, Kaa-san?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uuuh……that’s──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was unable to act honestly, but actually Maggot cherished her child much more than others.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot who lost her grounds for objecting slumped powerlessly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It would be as painful as getting slashed for her to not do her hobbies, but as someone who would give birth in her advanced age, she could only accept that there was truth in Baldr’s words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll restrain myself from anything excessive until this child is born……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr grinned like a certain god of a new world and nodded in satisfaction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Uoooooooooh! Little sister! Little sister flag is cominggggg!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Behind the scene, Baldr’s previous life, the soul of Oka Masaharu was secretly screaming in happiness, but no one knew about it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 12
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The report of Maggot’s pregnancy was welcomed by Cornelius House with shock and blessing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed this overly mischievous mother kept it quiet even to the people of the house until she told Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The people here were uneasy when they heard that the heir of the house became the lord of a dangerous land. But this news rewrote the gloomy air.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To make absolutely sure that Maggot whose age already reached the latter half of her thirties would give birth safely, an unexpected commotion for things like buying a new bed or reconsidering the menu was occurring in Cornelius House.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To celebrate the next birth of a legitimate child after Baldr, they even distributed the stored beer to the citizens. It drowned the mood of Cornelius territory in celebration.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Should I make her call me Onii-sama……however it’s also difficult to throw away Onii-chan.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although he had Seyruun who was like a big sister to him, Baldr was still an only child who wasn’t blessed with a sibling. He was also getting into a strange tension like the retainers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Especially Masaharu’s obsessive thoughts that were waiting impatiently for the birth of a little sister. It was gnawing at Baldr’s mind persistently.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A cute little girl with the same silver hair and blue eyes like him would call him 「Onii-chan」 with a lisping voice. And then she would follow behind him with trotting footsteps like a puppy and ask him 「Want to play?」. He had the confidence that his rational mind would crumble in front of such sight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「…….Baldr-sama, you’re making a slovenly face.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s posture was stiff as though he was watching a world far away. Seyruun pinched him at his side and dragged him back to reality.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sorry, sorry. But, when I think that I’ll have a little brother or little sister for the first time, I can’t stop imagining how I want to do this or that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I also only have older brother and older sister, so I can understand that feeling but……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She wondered why? Seyruun was feeling some kind of wicked feeling from Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun didn’t know. In the world where Masaharu lived, there existed a peculiar taste that was represented by the likes of Sister Pr○ncess or Oreim○.
    </span>
   </p>

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps because a new family member would be born, his engagement with Seyruun and Selina was accepted by his parents without any opposition.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I have no reason to oppose it if the two of them are alright with it.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll give you my blessing no matter who the girl is as long as it’s someone who you are in love with and vice versa. We don’t have any family honor to cling to at this point anyway.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     These parents were unexpectedly understanding for a couple who practiced monogamy. Baldr felt it was anticlimactic and let out a long sigh.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Thank you. To be honest, I thought Kaa-san would scold me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Ignis tried to get one more wife, he didn’t even want to imagine how Maggot would react.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The only image in his head was that day undoubtedly would become Ignis’s last day to live.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Seyruun, are you really fine with that?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot asked with the decision that if by any chance Seyruun said that she hated it, for the time being she would strangle Baldr until he was on the verge of death.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If I can be honest, then as expected I dislike it.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot’s eyes narrowed quietly. Her right hand was unconsciously moving towards the sword on her waist.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, fortunately Seyruun opened her mouth to continue her words before Maggot pulled out her sword.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「But a man like Baldr-sama is impossible to be monopolized by myself. No, surely I will become a hindrance for Baldr-sama’s fate if there is only me alone at his side.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina’s business talent, the backing of Silk’s Randolph House, the king’s trust. If Baldr lost even a single one of them, Baldr might lose his standing or even lose his life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A mere eldest son of a count wouldn’t need that much power, but the stormy destiny that dragged Baldr into various problems was far removed from the word peace.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s why I think that Baldr-sama needs more women who love him and can become his strength. Of course, I have no intention to surrendering the spot as Baldr-sama’s number one though.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Until several years ago, Baldr was just a troublesome naughty child.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That Baldr was climbing up until the rank of viscount and entrusted with a dangerous territory like Antrim while she was staring in blank amazement. It would be stranger to think that he would be able to return back to a peaceful and idyllic life at this point.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no doubt that something outrageous would happen in the future.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Considering the geopolitical environment of Antrim territory, it couldn’t be said that the possibility of fighting breaking out for real was low.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Seyruun, it looks like you will be able to become a good wife.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot smiled with a warm gaze as though she was looking at her own daughter.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The things that I can do aren’t much though.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She had no dissatisfaction with her occupation as maid, even so in regards to being of assistance to Baldr, she felt ashamed that she couldn’t even match Selina, let alone Silk.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Seyruun knew about Baldr’s habits and preferences more than anyone. For Baldr, her casual consideration and unselfish love was a part of his life that he couldn’t go without, just like how humans needed air to live.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t think like that──you’re helping me greatly, Seyruun.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Baldr-sama……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Good grief, restrain from making a love scene when in front of your parents.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot interrupted them when they were about to enter into a nice atmosphere unconsciously. Baldr’s cheeks reddened from shame, although Seyruun was looking slightly offended instead by the interruption.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    「Well, it’s fine if Seyruun can accept it. By the way, about what
    <ruby>
     that girl
     <rt>
      Agatha
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    said before the spar, she meant the
    <ruby>
     only daughter
     <rt>
      Silk
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    of Randolph House who I met at the knight academy, right?」
   </p>
   <p>
    「……So Kaa-san still remembers.」
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s shoulders slumped in dejection. But Maggot’s tone was different from what he expected. She sounded serious.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m telling you this for your own good. Even if you’re serious about her.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even if I’m serious about her, is it?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     These words were unlike his aberrant mother who extremely hated to compromise with her own will. Baldr was perplexed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What that girl is shouldering is heavier than you think. If someone without the strength to shoulder it gets involved with her, it will only result in unhappiness for both sides.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The darkness covering Trystovy Dukedom was deep. Silk was going to leap into that darkness voluntarily. It would be extremely difficult for her to act with her own free will from here on.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even her father Alford who was one of the ten great nobles and possessed immense influence wasn’t an exception.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Silk was a girl who could be categorized as someone Maggot personally liked, but the destiny that she shouldered, it was even more troublesome than Princess Rachel to put it mildly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Silk is a good friend of mine.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I don’t mind as long as you’re just playing friends with her. However, if you want to make that girl your wife, you might drag this country into war or in the worst case you might even turn this country into your enemy. That’s what I want to tell you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      Although
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     , Maggot smiled without saying her next thought out loud.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no way Baldr would end up settling down within a small place like Antrim with the abnormal caliber that he owned.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot gave him a warning just in case because it would absolutely be troublesome, but this son of hers most likely would get involved with the turmoil in Trystovy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot’s instinct was telling her that her son had the aspect of a hero that was calling disturbances toward himself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Well, Seyruun, if he is doing something like cheating on you, you can come consulting to me. I’ll make him regret being born as a man.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr and Ignis spontaneously felt their balls shrinking. They closed their thighs with blood leaving their face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 13
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How can this be! All my hard work until now has come to nothing!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A man who was past middle-aged was walking around his desk in irritation. He was biting on his thumbnail while rattling on.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man’s name was Alan Falkirk(アラン・フォルカーク).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was the feudal lord of a baronet territory that was located to the west of Antrim territory. Bradford territory was located even further west from here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His territory was located at the throat of Antrim territory that was sandwiched between the harsh mountains of Morgan mountain range and the border of Haurelia Kingdom. His territory was a logistic relay point that was essential for Antrim territory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alan had been using bribes to entice the magistrate of Antrim territory when it was still under the direct control of the royal family. He was obtaining vast profit by monopolizing circulation of goods to Antrim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The magistrate greatly wished to leave this kind of dangerous frontline and return back to the capital as soon as possible. In order to obtain funds for interfering with the personnel affairs in the royal court, the magistrate welcomed the bribes from Alan and there was no one getting in the way of Alan’s monopoly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But the situation changed when the magistrate was recalled and a real feudal lord was appointed for Antrim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The possibility that the new Viscount Antrim, Baldr, would meekly accept bribery from Alan was extremely low.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the first place, a feudal lord’s income was from the territory he governed. Asking that feudal lord to allow someone else to monopolize the circulation of goods in his territory in exchange for bribery was an absurd request that couldn’t possibly be accepted.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore, Baldr had a friendly relationship with Viscount Bradford, a major feudal lord with territory at the west that surrounded Baronet Falkirk’s territory. Baldr was also the best friend of Viscount Bradford’s daughter, Teresa, who became the fiancée of the crown prince of Sanjuan Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Alan was careless, it could be him who would be pressured from east and west. He could even lose the initiative in the goods circulation in such a situation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Shit! Even though I finally got a chance……that damn king is doing something unnecessary!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alan’s dream was using the money he earned as a bribe to somehow get promoted to baron with a territory that was closer to the capital.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, it wasn’t like Alan had talent in managing territory. He also wasn’t talented in martial arts to obtain achievement in the battlefield.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That meant, Baldr’s appointment also dashed Alan’s dream at the same time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Why do I have to go through something like this? Why-!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alan hit the flower vase on his desk in anger. But then a small voice of a servant fearfully notified him of a guest’s arrival.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「A guest?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alan frowned in suspicion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The time was already approaching night. It was impossible for a guest to be allowed to come at this time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the servant was expressly notifying him. That meant the possibility that the guest was a merchant or a commoner was low.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If there was a guest at this kind of time, the possibility was that it was a messenger from a noble with high status with an emergency business.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Whose messenger is it?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「T-that’s……the guest is carrying with him an introduction letter that is sealed with the crest of Count Hastings.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Hastings House was a middle level noble family in the kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The house wasn’t as noted as the ten great nobles, but the long history that the count house possessed and its vast blood relationship boasted a large influence within the country.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Alan once heard the rumor that since King Welkin came into power, there was a slight tendency for Hastings House to receive cold reception and how the house often acted in a critical manner toward the king.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, what kind of business could Count Hastings have with a minor baronet house in a remote place like this?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I have made you wait. Please forgive the ill-manner of my servants because this place is a countryside.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the guest room, a man with shortly cropped hair and a sticky looking gaze that reminded Alan of a lizard was waiting for him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s an honor to be able to meet you, my lord. My name is Toby from Hastings House. Please allow me to express an apology from the bottom of my heart for visiting at night like this.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man who introduced himself as Toby bowed courteously and smiled.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From how he behaved, it could be seen that this man had received some degree of education from a noble house.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And yet, Alan couldn’t help but to feel a black thing coiling inside his stomach.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s truly unfortunate, but until now I have never been blessed with a chance to form a connection with the lord count. And so, I wonder what is the meaning of your arrival here?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──I’m truly ashamed to ask this from my lord but, can I ask for other people to be cleared from this room?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Are you saying that the people of my house cannot be trusted?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「My lord has strictly commanded me that this message is only for the ear of Falkirk-sama alone.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although it was unpleasant, he was facing a messenger from a count.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alan helplessly nodded at his butler to clear away the servants from the guest room.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Is it alright with this?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「My deepest gratitude for Falkirk-sama’s cooperation.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Toby faced Alan and straightened his seated posture before he bowed deeply.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However his eyes were emitting a radiance of cold intelligence that was measuring Alan’s caliber.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……It seems that Falkirk-sama is currently in an unfortunate situation.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Toby shook his head to make it look like he was sympathizing greatly with Alan.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alan’s mood was worsened by the man’s exaggerated acting and he scowled.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although he was a small and weak noble from a remote region, he was still a fully-fledged lord. There was no reason why he should just let a man who was nothing more than a messenger make fun of him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I wonder what you’re talking about. I don’t think there is anything in this kind of small village that the lord count needs to concern himself with.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Good heavens! What can you call Antrim being put under the rule of a mere child from Cornelius as anything else but a disaster!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     How far was Hastings House aware of the situation here?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was Alan’s concern.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Being betrayed by someone who they thought of as an ally was an everyday occurrence in noble society.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alan thought of Baldr’s appointment as troublesome, but it didn’t mean that he wasn’t considering forming a friendly relation with Baldr and building a partnership with him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But of course, if his interests happened to coincide with Count Hastings, he would be willing to join hands with him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Certainly, the land of Antrim might be too great of a burden for a child. But I believe my house can be of help to him.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     While Baldr was governing Antrim at the beginning where he didn’t even know left from right, the cooperation of Falkirk House must be something that he desperately wanted.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Here Alan was implicitly informing that he would ally himself with the side that would advantage him more.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Toby renewed his perception of Alan. It seemed this man wasn’t as stupid as he thought.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though Alan’s talent in managing territory was average, he was able to calculate the pros and cons for himself at the very least.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although, if he wasn’t at least this smart then it wouldn’t be worth it to manipulate him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「About that, I wonder if Baldr-dono will really need Falkirk-sama’s help.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hou……are you saying that even knowing what kind of land Antrim is?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although it was only reluctantly, Alan had governed this area for long. He had the self-confidence of his own knowledge.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no way anyone could rule Antrim while ignoring Falkirk House that was commanding the exit and entrance of the rigorous mountain range Morgan.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Is Falkirk-sama aware that Savaran Company, which is under the umbrella of Baldr-dono, is a prominent company that has a partnership with Dowding Company?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──With Dowding Company, you say?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Destitute nobles like Cornelius and Antrim that only had the weak economic capability of a remote region couldn’t possibly be related to such a big name.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Dowding Company was already one of the huge companies in the capital from the beginning, but recently it was growing rapidly and forming a gigantic financial conglomerate that didn’t allow any rival to catch up to it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From financing to goods circulation, there was no more economic activity in the capital that wasn’t influenced by Dowding Company right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Toby was saying that with the backing of that Dowding Company, there was no guarantee that Baldr wouldn’t be able to monopolize even the goods circulation in Falkirk.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「In the capital, the commoners are gathering money and beginning to encroach even into the range of occupation of us nobles without regard to their lowly status. My master is aspiring to correct such travesty.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That is truly a noble aspiration.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Thinking back, before that detestable war broke out, the commoner’s status couldn’t rise as high as right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The kingdom’s law was guaranteeing the right of the commoners, but that was just at the surface. There shouldn’t be any chance for commoners to go against nobles.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, right now commoners were the vital point of the kingdom’s economy. It was represented by general trading companies like Dowding Company.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alan himself was also holding a dissatisfaction at such a change in society.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「My master is feeling concerned with how many nobles there are who have their eyes blinded by money and pander to the commoners. It’s self-evident that any proud noble must not accommodate the money-worship of the commoners. However, the current Viscount Antrim is someone who is pushing for economical integration with the commoners instead. It’s very crucial to be careful when dealing with that person.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For the traditional nobles, the most important things were their bloodline along with their duty and responsibility that accompanies the weight of their house’s history.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Someone like Baldr who was increasing his influence by developing commercial products and using companies to expand the marketing of their product was nothing but traitors in the eyes of those who were trying to maintain the framework of nobility.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the first place, the fact that someone like Baldr who was still fifteen years old was receiving viscount rank itself was perceived by many people as an act of reducing the kingdom’s nobility system to a mere formality.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──This Alan Falkirk is also deeply impressed by what the lord count is saying. Be that as it may, the appointment of the new viscount is also the will of his majesty the king. I am unable to say anything rash.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter how irritated he was towards Baldr, this appointment was a direct royal command from the king. It would only be a political suicide if a puny noble like Alan was criticizing the king’s decision openly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No, to oppose the current Welkin whose power had drastically increased since the last war might become a fatal mistake even for a noted noble family like the count.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Of course, to oppose his majesty the king is something unthinkable. However Alan-sama, can’t you recall the past? Before that war, his majesty couldn’t possibly ignore our words and would lend his ears to our opinion.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Toby didn’t say that the king was only reluctantly doing that because of the balance of power at that time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To return to the power balance of that time, the king’s current power was only a hindrance. Of course this maverick from Cornelius who was aiding that king was also a hindrance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Besides, Falkirk-sama also cannot act like this is someone else’s problem. Baldr-dono is the eldest son of Cornelius House that has a lot of enemies. If Haurelia invades Antrim because of their grudge, then the possibility of Falkirk-sama getting dragged into it won’t be low.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Umu, certainly I wish to avoid only the second coming of the war no matter what.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Alan, the annihilation of Antrim House wasn’t something that he could forget at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If his family was late in escaping for even just one day, they would also fall into the hand of Haurelia army. Alan remembered the terror of that day like it was only yesterday.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If Falkirk-sama wishes to not get involved, you only need to block the path. An unfortunate accident is something that can occur anytime.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──What do you want to say?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m only speaking to myself here but……there is a jutting out bedrock at the valley of Morgan mountain range where the only main road that is connecting Antrim and Falkirk passes through, isn’t there? If this path is blocked by some falling rocks, then even an army won’t be able to pass.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「T-that’s……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Certainly, Falkirk House would be saved like that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, if such a thing happened, Viscount Antrim would lose his path to escape and get annihilated once more without any doubt.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s not anyone’s fault if an incident occurs. That’s simply the will of heaven. Although when humans follow the will of heaven, surely they will also have their wish granted as a reward.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Toby implicitly hinted at the possibility of Alan’s promotion in rank. It greatly shook Alan’s heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he could secure his own safety while obtaining the backing of a count house at the same time──then it couldn’t be helped even if an accident occurred.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This is not a complicated matter. Falkirk-sama only needs to choose the path that will be to your benefit, that’s all……Hastings House will also aiding Falkirk-sama’s effort.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「When a national disaster is approaching Mauricia Kingdom, a national disaster works to my territory’s advantage and prevents the enemy country’s attack from happening. Such a thing can also possibly happen.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Of course it’s possible. The heaven will help those who are walking the path of righteousness after all.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (It is outside my jurisdiction to know whether the righteousness of Falkirk House will be recognized or not though.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The objective of the anti-king faction that was centered around Hastings House was the forfeiture of the royal authority by sacrificing Antrim territory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Baldr was attacked and destroyed helplessly, they would be able to hold Welkin responsible as the one who appointed Baldr as the lord of that territory. Cornelius House’s loyalty to the royal family would also decrease after they lost their heir.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Welkin tried to dispatch a large scale reinforcement that included the noble’s troops to save Baldr, the nobles would join hands to refuse this and demanded the king to dispatch only the national troops.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If a lot of lives and funds were consumed and the national troops were exhausted from the battle, the king’s power should also weaken.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Hastings was scheming to have the royal family’s strength reduced, just like how the nobles were ruined from the previous war.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then Falkirk-sama, please do as you see fit from here on.
    </span>
    」
