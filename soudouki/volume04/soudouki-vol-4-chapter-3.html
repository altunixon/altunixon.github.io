   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 1
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Stop over there!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A soldier of Antrim stopped a portly merchant who was riding a horse carriage and approached.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Thank you for your hard work. Here is my draft.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uh huh.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The soldier took the draft from the merchant with a business-like attitude and checked the draft’s seal and handwriting.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The three major roads that connected Antrim territory with Haurelia Kingdom had a checkpoint on each road. Recently, the number of people visiting these checkpoints was continuing to increase without any sign of stopping.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because of that, the soldiers who were in charge of controlling the coming and going of the roads were swamped with work even after their number had been increased.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This is certainly a draft from Count Savoie. What is your load?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yes. I’m planning on selling cotton wool in Antrim and exchanging it with string.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There is a lot of string trading recently……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The string produced in Antrim is relatively cheap in proportion to its quality, after all……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「So it’s like that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The soldier didn’t seem to know at all that there was a workshop of the new type spinner in Antrim. He only nodded without looking interested.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The merchant kept smiling, but inside he couldn’t hide his disappointment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Good grief, he isn’t even looking interested──this is why country bumpkins are just hopeless!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The true identity of this man who disguised himself as a merchant was Sobat, the head of intelligence for Count Savoie.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His subordinates were only sending him uncertain pieces of information from rumors. In addition, some of his people were even starting to get discovered, so in the end he had no other choice but to infiltrate Antrim personally.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (However, I don’t think that my men can be caught with security of this level……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seeing how unwary the soldier just now, it was hard to believe that a spy would be caught as long as they didn’t commit a great blunder.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, before this the checkpoints here would only be something like a place to send soldiers as punishment. It was already surprising enough that a proper soldier with the drive to do his job was stationed here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I heard that the new lord count is a person who is really capable.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat made a careful smile and made a small talk with the soldier. The soldier’s expression turned happy for a moment, but he seemed to catch himself and recomposed himself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t make any unnecessary talk about some rumors.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How thoughtless of me, please be lenient on me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat courteously bowed, but he wanted to click his tongue inside his heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The soldier’s reaction told him two things.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     First, the soldier looked happy when Sobat praised the new lord as though it was he himself who was praised. That meant the count of Antrim had won over the heart of the population.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was something unusual for a feudal lord who hadn’t even taken his post for a year.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter how unmotivated and incompetent the previous magister was, ordinarily it would take four or five years for the population to become attached to their new lord.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Edo shogunate also forcefully relocated all the influential daimyos with the objective of making it so that those daimyos couldn’t wage a substantial war until they managed to seize the heart of their subjects.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If those daimyos failed to seize the heart of the population and caused an uprising, the national power would decay and in the end their territory would be confiscated by the shogunate and their clan crushed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was abnormal for Baldr to already succeed in obtaining firm support all the way down to even a lowly soldier.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Second, at the minimum people in governmental work like soldiers and government officials had been formally forbidden to make idle talk.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Actually, even this soldier wanted to boast about the blessings that Baldr had brought to Antrim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From how the soldier looked like he had to forcibly stop himself from talking, it was clear that there was some kind of will from above that was holding him back.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This could be said as an extremely troubling situation for someone who was trying to gather information here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For a spy at Sobat’s level, it was possible to analyze several pieces of information that he obtained from small talk to reach a conclusion to some degree, but even that was impossible to do if he couldn’t obtain any information.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──You can pass. A warning before that, if you enter a place that is forbidden to enter, you won’t be able to avoid punishment even with a draft from Count Savoie.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Thank you for the warning.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Looks like this mission will be far harder than I thought.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat was convinced that Antrim wasn’t a burden for the Mauricia Kingdom like in the past anymore. This territory was changing into a formidable enemy that Haurelia Kingdom couldn’t underestimate.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 2
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Shit! Why was I found out that quickly? There should be a limit no matter how much they strengthened their eyes……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A man was pushing his way through a trackless path while running with gasping breaths.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Two of his comrades who accompanied him had already become silent corpses. He lost sight of one other and he didn’t know what had happened to him. Most likely, he was also continuing to run away like him for dear life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was safe to enter Antrim by using a draft like Sobat, but their actions would be limited that way. They could also only bring weapons in a limited fashion because of the need to hide it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The spies from Haurelia also considered extortion and kidnapping to some degree, so they attempted to infiltrate Antrim illegally through the border, but──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Zirco, go over there. Around twenty meters more.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A lovely voice reached Zirco’s ear like a whisper.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was an application of wind magic. The mercenaries that Zirco was leading worked together with each other and continued to pursue their targets accurately like in a hunt.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Heh! So he is coming to my spot of all people, what an unlucky guy!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although she said that, Zirco was pulling out her great sword happily.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even someone like her who turned slovenly when facing the temptation of food would become a first-rate warrior who bared her predator instinct when standing on the battlefield like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco filled the tip of her feet with strength, like a beast that was gnawing into the ground.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She couldn’t be compared to a monster like Maggot, but Zirco’s body strengthening also wasn’t something that could be underestimated. The origin of her nickname as Zirco the Gale was her mighty blow that made full use of her charging power. She was famous for this among the mercenaries.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco’s huge body was slowly leaning forward.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the same time, her feet that were stepping firmly on the ground also sank a few centimeters into the soil. The pebbles that were coincidentally under her foot were shot off with a dry sound.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ten more meters.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The wind magic that notified her of the situation became the signal. Zirco’s body accelerated explosively like a fighter jet that was fired from a catapult.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「GET OUTTA MY WAAAAAAAAAAYY!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco rushed through the distance of ten meters in the blink of an eye. Anything that got in her way, whether it was a tree or a rock would be torn apart if they got hit by her attack.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was too bad for the man who got hit by a slash that came from far outside a sword range. He wasn’t even allowed to perceive Zirco coming at him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Eh……w-what is……?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man was only able to speak until there.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His entrails burst out from his torn apart stomach due to the pressure on his abdomen. At the same time, the man instantly lost consciousness due to the rapid decline of his blood pressure.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a heroic attack from Zirco that took down everything in its way. It didn’t even allow the target to realize that he had been killed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Unlike Maggot, Zirco needed to charge her strength and couldn’t use it in succession. But that might and speed were enough to call the attack as godly fast.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What? You kill them again huh, Zirco.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A petite silhouette came down from above with a sarcastic voice. It was the mercenary Cell.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Too bad, I’m not good with holding back.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aa~aa, the guy got completely split into two like this……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Cell himself had splendidly caught another spy alive.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Cell used a knife that was smeared with paralyzing poison. He was a type that displayed his strength fully in this kind of unconventional warfare.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I knew you were going to catch one anyway, so it should be alright for me to do whatever I please.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yuck, this is why you will never be able to become a wife.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s not your damn business!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As expected, Zirco who had reached the age where she could be called an old maid replied angrily when Cell pointed out that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She wouldn’t be worrying if it was that easy to find a man who would receive a savage mercenary like her as a wife. Besides, Zirco didn’t have the slightest intention to discard her current self just for the sake of a man.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Cleanup finished. Let’s go back, Zirco.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The battlefield control magician Marine(マリン) announced the end of their mission.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sure thing. You were a big help just now, Marine.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I was only doing as I was told. You should thank Baldr-sama instead for thinking up something like this.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Marine let out a deep sigh seeing how the battle went without a hitch like usual.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She commanded the battle by using wind magic to send messages and used an application of water magic to detect heat sources. By combining these two things, it gave an overwhelming advantage to Zirco and others in unconventional warfare.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter how hard the spies tried to hide themselves, it was impossible for them to eliminate the influence of their body temperature on the air around them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If that was detected using magic, it would be possible to have an advantage even when battling on a mountain or in a forest, where there was a lot of cover.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The battle system that Baldr thought up was displaying an immense effect like this. It had already consigned countless spies into oblivion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I wonder if our work will decrease a little now?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Cell answered Zirco’s muttering.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If it’s you, will you be able to ignore a mysterious area that continue to absorb the life of spies?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fuu……looks like it will be a bit longer till we can have a day off……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco hung her head down while recalling the numerous delicious foods that she tasted at Baldr’s side, pressing her hand on her stomach that had slimmed down slightly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The price of the spies’ lives were cheap as it was.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco’s ordeals would continue for a while more until there were new mercenaries to reinforce them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 3
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat advanced through a main road of Antrim. He put on a relaxed expression while observing his surroundings vigilantly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What surprised him the most was how many soldiers there were.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Savoie House only had around 800 soldiers at best in times of peace. When it was a time of war, around 2000 people could be pressed into military service. This number was considered quite numerous, no noble would have the leeway to just leave those soldiers to stay idle daily.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Considering how tight the security at the border was and how their spies kept getting captured, most likely Antrim possessed a military force that rivaled or perhaps even surpassed Savoie House.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Impossible.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The livelihood of the population that he saw from the street didn’t look that different from the population of Savoie territory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Antrim territory’s size didn’t even reach half of Savoie territory. Normally it should be impossible for such a territory to maintain this many soldiers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Don’t tell me……Mauricia’s king is seriously starting to prepare for war?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If it was impossible for the economic strength of Antrim, that meant there was someone else who was lending money for this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The most likely person who did that in Sobat’s opinion was King Welkin who appointed Baldr to be Count Antrim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In that case, this mission that fell on the shoulders’ of Sobat was important. If Antrim was being fortified for preparation prior to an invasion of Haurelia, Savoie House would be exposed to danger.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat didn’t let the uneasiness inside his heart to appear at the surface and kept acting like a sociable merchant. He stayed in an inn at the city of Kosse that was located at the center of Antrim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The main road stretched to the east and west from there. It would take two days to reach Gawain castle and the city around it at the east.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Welcome.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The expression of the inn owner was bright when welcoming a customer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The inside of the inn was also kept clean. Seeing how there was a refined antique decorating the inside, it seemed the business was doing quite well.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll stay for a night. Please give my horse water and fodder. Looks like the business is going really well here.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yes. Since the new lord came, the number of people coming and going has doubled. Thanks to that, business is booming.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat chuckled inside his heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As expected, unlike the soldiers, it seemed it was impossible for even the count to close the populace’s mouth.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I was also surprised after coming here. This is my first time coming to Antrim for business, what kinds of people are coming here?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat had also learned that recently, the number of good quality string produced from Antrim was increasing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the number of people coming and going wouldn’t double just from that. There should be another big reason.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There are a lot of rowdy mercenaries and wanderers searching for work coming here. After all, this place is originally an abundant land, as long as war doesn’t break out. When my father was young, the rock salt of Antrim was a famous high-class commodity.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Actually, other than rock salt, Antrim was also blessed with abundant mineral resources like iron.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because of that too, this Antrim was a land that would be contested by the two countries right from the start.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The new lord brought a lot of soldiers from his family territory and the capital, and thanks to that the safety of the highway is improved greatly and everyone can do their business without worry.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     So that was how. The lord seized the population’s heart by improving public order and cultivating industry at the same time──the viscount Antrim really understood the subtleties of economy despite his youth.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No wonder I kept passing soldiers along the way. However, it must be difficult to maintain that many soldiers.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the very least there was no doubt that such a thing would be too much for the finances of a normal viscount.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Perhaps……it seems the lord is really generous with money that even the mercenaries have never really done anything outrageous. From the rumors I heard, it seems the lord received a loan from the royal family.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Is the lord count a favored retainer of the king?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Who knows……I was told that the lord is the childhood friend of Teresa-sama who is the fiancée of Sanjuan Kingdom’s crown prince, and it was also he who settled the marriage talk deal.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat also knew about that rumor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was certainly a fact that the viscount was once dispatched to Sanjuan as an ambassador. Most likely, the rumor about how he was the one settling the marriage deal was also true.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That accomplishment seemed to be enough to promote to be viscount.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I see……looks like Antrim’s future is bright.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This land had only kept declining since the war but……truly, I have nothing but thanks to our lord.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat enjoyed an idle talk with the inn owner for a while before he went to his room and sat down on a thoroughly cleaned bed. He let out a deep sigh.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The situation might be even more serious than he thought.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The development of Antrim and the expansion of the military power here weren’t the work of Viscount Antrim but the policy of the king who was behind him. The possibility of that was high.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His lord Count Savoie didn’t want a new war to break out, but if Antrim’s strengthening was the Mauricia king’s plan, it would be necessary to start the war while the preparations here still hadn’t finished.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This is……I should resolve myself.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat knew very well how dangerous it would be to spy at the center of Antrim while the security was this strict.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the pressing situation that Sobat hypothesized was far more important than his life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had no intention to undervalue his own life, but he knew firsthand how just a single piece of information could possibly affect the lives of tens of thousands of people. There was no reason for him to hold his life dear.

     Part 4
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「S-say, perhaps we should just stop this? As I thought, this is just strange!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Agatha, can you return to your usual self soon?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr had lost count how many times Agatha had spoken about returning back to Antrim with this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha hadn’t returned to her usual confident and sadistic self at all since several days ago. Baldr scratched his forehead in bewilderment seeing her like this. It wasn’t because he wanted to torment Agatha, not at all (he insisted).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Because! It’s impossible for someone worthless like me to be adopted into Randolph House! What if I’m treated like an impudent woman……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──It would be better to be called Onee-san by Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please calm down Agatha. You must have known that there is a discord between the nobles at the central and the nobles at the remote region. Cornelius House is, in the end, just our last resort.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「But……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Randolph House was far different from the average noble.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The seats of the ten great nobles were mostly occupied by duke, a rank higher than marquis. But Marquis Randolph’s influence was in the top three among such nobles. He was counted as one of the strongest nobles in the kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Though of course it was greatly influenced by the special circumstance of how Silk was the one in possession of the right to inherit the throne of the overthrown Trystovy Kingdom, and how Trystovy nobles who became political refugees in Mauricia Kingdom were behind Marquis Randolph.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     By any means, it wasn’t a house that a mere daughter of a baronet house could interact with so casually.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha was a close friend with Silk due to her history as Silk’s private tutor, but even so it made her stomach ache with anxiety when she thought that she would become Silk’s step-sister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Six days had passed since they departed from Antrim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Around this time there was no doubt that Antrim had turned into a terrifying hell on earth with both Baldr and Agatha’s absence.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr offered a meager prayer for his subordinates who he abandoned on the battlefield.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .

     Part 5
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Brandon-san! Please take care of the settlement of the salary payment!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The woman from accounting piled up a tall stack of paperwork in front of Brandon.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The height of the stack was already making Brandon’s face hidden.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Marquez-san! What happened with the repair approval for the east highway?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Beside him, Cecil was yelling at Marquez without even wiping the sweat off her forehead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The settlement is pending! What about Cecile’s medical care aid program?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Marquez also answered back powerlessly without even hiding the color of exhaustion on his face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s also still pending!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The administration center of Antrim was truly a battlefield.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The staff was running around hurriedly. Countless paperwork was fluttering in the air. And then the mountains of paperwork, paperwork, and paperwork that kept getting transported in.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The reliable Agatha with her amazing paperwork processing ability and Baldr with his excellent decisiveness and discernment were both absent right now. Brandon, who was entrusted to lead this place in their absence was tormented by a lack of sleep and an intense stomachache.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This……how can I deal with something like this!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Brandon wasn’t incompetent by any means. Rather, he was an administrative official who could be categorized as quite capable.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore, he was also a person with a strong love for his hometown. He wished to devote his all for Antrim’s sake even since the government of the previous magistrate.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m begging you Agatha-san, please come back quickly. I won’t say that you’re a sadist or a slave driver any more……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Brandon muttered spell-like words that undoubtedly would earn him a beating if Agatha heard it, while his hands continue to work without resting even now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The future of Antrim was hanging on his shoulders.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It didn’t matter even if he was crying or wailing, as a man there was no option for him to stop working.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ah, Brandon-san. Here’s more.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A new mountain of paperwork was piled on with a thud. Who could blame him for screaming?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!」

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 6
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha’s footsteps were heavy even now after arriving at the familiar Randolph House.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uuu……we arrived……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What’s with that tone! You really don’t know when to give up.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「My lord, you can say that because it’s not you who come here to get adopted!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Certainly it’s not me who will be adopted, but I’ll be the one who has to talk, you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no way a low class noble like Agatha could ask something like
    </span>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      please adopt me
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     , so naturally Baldr would be the one who made the request as the lord of Antrim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was something that he was forced to do because of a pressing need. To be honest, Baldr himself also felt like there was a hole opening in his stomach.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Please wait over here.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The butler of Randolph House watched the conversation of the two youngsters with a warm smile. Even so, he avoided saying anything and led them courteously to a guest room.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The guest room was decorated with a splendid stuffed lion that wasn’t there when Baldr visited before, as though to display the financial strength of Randolph House.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This is rare……I wonder if this is from Trystovy.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The habitat of lions were mainly in the south. They only lived in a part of the Sanjuan Kingdom and Trystovy Dukedom. This was also Baldr’s first time seeing it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As always, Marquis Randolph had a connection that stretched around Trystovy Dukedom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What, you’ve run away already?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford appeared with a sarcastic comment without even trying to hide his displeasure. Baldr smiled wryly and bowed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I have no intention to run away, but I have various things that I need for obtaining victory.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph. I completely thought that you came here for a consultation of how to clean up your mess after violating Agatha.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford was completely joking, but Agatha who had little experience with that kind of thing due to her personality was reflexively holding her breath while blushing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oi……brat, don’t tell me……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford’s complexion changed. At the same time, a splendid oil painting that depicted the lake surface of Aleister Lake inside the room was shaking and making a thumping sound for some reason.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Wait! Why are you turning red! Please spare me Agatha. You’re making it look like I have done something to you!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I won’t let you say that you haven’t done anything after showing such a thing to me!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Before, I was telling you jokingly to lay your hand on Agatha, but to think that you’ve really done it……even with these eyes of mine, I was unable to predict that you would grow into an enemy of woman that surpassed even that Ignis!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Wrong! That’s completely wrong! Believe me! PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The oil painting hanging on the wall was shaking unnaturally once more with *bump, bump* sound once more.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha turned her gaze there with a bit of suspicion, but Baldr who was under condemnation didn’t have any leeway to notice such a thing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Your excellency! It’s true there was an unfortunate accident, but I swear that I haven’t laid a hand on Miss Agatha. Besides, no one will leap into a thorny bush by choice!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha’s pride as a woman was wounded for being treated as a landmine like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Do you really need to go that far?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps she should seriously commit a mistake at this occasion. Agatha was thinking of such a thing that would make Baldr run away crying if he heard it while raising her voice in protest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Then, can you imagine yourself as a good wife or a good lover like Seyruun and Selina?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That kind of me won’t be me anymore!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The answer came in 0,2 second. It was a refreshing decisiveness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford too had guessed the situation to a degree from this exchange between the two.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Most likely it was the truth that Baldr didn’t lay his hand on Agatha.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although, it also didn’t look like Agatha herself wasn’t harboring such feelings toward Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How about stopping there. I don’t think that you two came from Antrim just to show me your lovers’ quarrel.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr and Agatha finally returned to their senses with the calm words from Alford. They stopped their ugly quarrel.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Forgive us for showing something unsightly.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph. That was certainly unsightly, but it would be most satisfactory if Silk became disillusioned with you because of it.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Thud*, a sound like a head hitting a wall came from the direction of the oil pointing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I don’t want to be hated by Silk as her friend, but……we are asking for your excellency’s time today is of course not for showing a lovers’ quarrel.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Obviously. If you actually came just for that then I’d challenge you to a duel.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was able to easily get a meeting with Alford because he was Silk’s school friend, a favorite of King Welkin, and also someone who had brought benefit for Randolph House politically.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, if Baldr was just a normal viscount, it would be difficult for him to meet Alford without an intermediation from an influential noble.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And yet Baldr showed no sign of timidity at all. Agatha renewed her perception of him. As she thought, Baldr was really abnormal.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Actually──I’m wondering if it might be possible for Randolph House to take Miss Agatha over here an adopted child.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ……*Thud*.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From the other side of the oil painting, there was a sound like something with the weight of a human stumbling and falling on the floor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 7
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat finally arrived at the castle town of Gawain Castle on his horse carriage. It was two days after he left the city of Kosse.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His arrival was late from his original plan because of the rain that fell on the way. The sun had already been falling in the west since a long time ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the castle town was still lively even now that the day had turned into night. It renewed Sobat’s surprise.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter the territory, in most cases it would only be the sex industry that would still be open at night.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Savoie territory was the same. There was no brothel intended for nobles like in the capital, but at least there was no lack of establishment there for the commoners to forget their troubles for the night.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since he heard at the inn in Kosse how the number of guests had doubled, he thought that the castle town’s state would also be amazing. But this number of people surpassed his expectation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Fundamentally commoners only had enough money to make their ends meet for the day──especially the local people, they wouldn’t be that proactive in spending their money at the pleasure quarter.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was to say, the possibility was high that the people who came to Antrim from other regions were occupying the greater percentage of the liveliness before him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat stopped walking in front of a signboard that had the words 『Hound of Spring』 carved onto it with a quirky calligraphic style.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Is there an empty room here?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yeah, it’ll be ten copper coins for a night. There’ll be an extra two copper coins if you want your horse taken care of.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was an inn with its first floor used as a bar.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The boorish looking innkeeper smiled bitterly. Sobat took off his coat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「For now I’ll stay for three days. Also can you give me something to fill my stomach? I haven’t eaten anything since noon.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oi, lead the horse to the backyard.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sure thing!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A child around ten years old who didn’t really look like the innkeeper replied energetically. He took away the horse carriage from Sobat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then he led the horse with a splendid rein handling that didn’t match his age. Sobat narrowed his eyes and stared at the boy with delight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Time really passes quickly──how old is he?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「He is eleven this year. I have also aged a lot, huh.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat nodded and sat at the counter in front of the innkeeper without hesitation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There were still around five or six customers in the bar, but there wasn’t any sign of anyone approaching the innkeeper due to his large body and boorish atmosphere that didn’t have any amiability.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It had been around eleven years since Sobat and the innkeeper parted ways.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s lamb grilled with herbs. I got good meat today. ……Are you alright with drinking ale?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What is that black alcohol they are drinking over there? It doesn’t look like ale.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s a novel alcohol, made from roasted barley. The lord ordered its creation, and it seems it’s called stout. Even though the lord isn’t that much older than my kid, he is knowledgeable about alcohol. It’s a bit popular among the commoners.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……I’ll try that one.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat who was just a normal human couldn’t even possibly imagine that Baldr was borrowing Masaharu’s knowledge, and that he was in the middle of experimenting on how to create pilsner. He was even starting the experiment of beekeeping in order to mass produce high class mead!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However Sobat felt a feeling of affection toward Baldr at the end of the brusque innkeeper’s words. He instinctually felt the need to change his perception toward Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed he had to revise his perception that Baldr was just a puppet of the king.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Sorry, but this is a talk about work.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Tsk……even though I was starting to think that I’d be able to retire soon without anything significant happening.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sorry.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The innkeeper’s name was Dario Bowen(ダリオ・ボーエン).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was once an associate of Sobat. He integrated into the local populace for the sake of the future war and spent a long time earning the trust of the local populace. He was what would be called a sleeper agent on modern Earth.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Right now he was one of the influential men in the castle city of Gawain.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although he was a brusque person, he was a diligent person and also familiar with fighting at the level of a mercenary. Other innkeepers often relied on him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This success wasn’t because Dario was capable as a spy. It was because Dario was fundamentally a reliable man.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I have tied the horse and fed them!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Dario patted the head of his son who returned cheerfully. He didn’t even smile and told him to go to sleep.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat caught a glimpse of a clumsy parent and child love there. He looked down melancholically.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sobat felt agonized that he had to make use of an ordinary and good person like Dario.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Originally, he was sending Dario here to Antrim because Dario wasn’t suited to be a spy. He sent him here to keep him away from bloodshed, and yet…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But, he couldn’t go by his personal feelings. As the head of the intelligence agency directly under Count Savoie, he had no other choice but to borrow Dario’s help.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After the last of the customers finished drinking their sake and returned to his bedroom, the two of them started to talk with ale on their hand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The number of soldiers here is really many.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The war is over and the civil war at Trystovy is also calming down for the moment. There are a lot of mercenaries who don’t have work because of that. Nordland Empire and Gartlake Kingdom are still skirmishing like usual in the north, but there aren’t that many fanciful people who want to go that far north.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There wasn’t any war in Antrim, but Baldr was fully relying on his money to recruit a lot of regular soldiers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In other words, it was like the offer of regular employment was rolling in front of the mercenaries while the demand for them in their irregular employment was declining.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was only natural for mercenaries from every corner of the continent to rush here with letters of recommendation (curriculum vitae) in their hand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Dario glanced at the grimacing Sobat and continued.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There are also several famous mercenaries with nicknames here……it’ll be better if you don’t underestimate them.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「But……they’re just mercenaries in the end, right?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wasn’t just Haurelia, every country in the continent was half-hearted about recruiting mercenaries into regular employment. It was because their loyalty couldn’t be trusted.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if Antrim was recruiting mercenaries to be regular soldiers, Sobat couldn’t help but feel doubtful on how useful they would be as fighting strength.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’ll be the case if you think normally, but there are cooperative mercenaries among them like Zirco the Gale. In addition……any veteran mercenaries know very well just how terrifying the Silver Light Maggot is.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「So they don’t want to turn that demon into an enemy……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Really, that woman was really a curse towards Haurelia Kingdom no matter how much time passed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If the morale of the troops here was maintained by fear towards that demon, then it was highly possible that even mercenaries would turn into a fighting strength that couldn’t be underestimated.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so……Sobat tilted his head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Just where did the money for that come from?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Savoie House that was in the category of relatively wealthy in Haurelia Kingdom would find it very hard to employ several hundred additional mercenaries.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If the situation was already like this in Antrim alone, what would happen if the whole Mauricia Kingdom converted its economic strength that was more developed than Haurelia into battle strength? Sobat felt a chill just from imagining that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「One of the viscount’s fiancées is the president of Savaran Company. Naturally, Dowding Company is also taking a part here. Most likely……as you can see from that ale, the viscount himself is also really talented with money.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You’re saying, it’s not because the king is involved?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I don’t know that far. At the very least it’s certain the viscount isn’t as simple as just a manipulated puppet.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Sobat didn’t appear, Dario would also honestly rejoice at Baldr’s appointment as one of the populace of Antrim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……This is troublesome.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Until he arrived in this city, Sobat was thinking that the change in Antrim was due to the king’s instruction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, if this change was simply due to the feudal lord’s own discretion, that made the type of danger here completely different.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The problem was too great to be ignored, but with this the possibility of there being a plan to invade Haurelia Kingdom drastically lower.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No, either way we can’t just stay quiet watching Antrim developing even more than this.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Count Savoie who didn’t agree with war couldn’t just stay quiet seeing this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Antrim’s development was just that striking.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If this place was left alone like this, Antrim would turn into a sharp blade that was pointed at Haurelia’s throat in the future. They had to do something before that happened.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I want to learn more about the security of Antrim. Do you have any information?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Dario folded his arms and tilted his head with a complicated expression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Dario who was well known among people of the same profession had various intel coming to him, but there was no military information among that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……I heard that laborers are mobilized on the border. Something else also caught my attention──blacksmiths and magicians were gathered some time ago.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Blacksmith and magician?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Both were occupations with limited use.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They were fundamentally used for production work, so Sobat couldn’t even imagine how they were used at the national border that was a frontline.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, putting it another way, such a big secret was being hidden at the border. The importance for Sobat to investigate it kept increasing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all, there was no way that the shadowy force of Savoie and Selvi could be easily found and killed at the border.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no doubt that there was something there that would trouble Viscount Antrim if it was discovered. Furthermore, it was something beyond common sense so far. Such a thing was currently in progress towards completion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sorry to ask you this but, please help me to slip in among the people transporting material to the border. I won’t bother you anymore after that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As expected, he had to confirm it with his own eyes. It was impossible with his ability to deduce the correct conclusion using just indirect information.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……I have a wholesaler acquaintance who stocks up foodstuff. I’ll try asking him.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter how secretive the location was, it would still need food, water, clothing, and medicine. If Sobat could slip among the people transporting those things, he would be able to manage the rest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then he wouldn’t need to disturb Dario’s life even more than this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I’m the man who is called the Owl of Sendia(センディア). I’ll bring back the intel even if it cost me my life!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 8
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Taking Agatha as my adopted child──you are asking that from me?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      He is angry as expected!
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha shrunk into herself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The opponent was just too bad. Alford was an influential person who could crush Agatha like an insect with his fingertip if he felt like it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Besides, this request was impossible from the start. There was no way a troublesome and strong-minded woman like her could be adopted by one of the ten great nobles!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Of course. Or I should say, there is no other choice than your excellency for this.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr ignored the flustered Agatha and stayed annoyingly calm.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She couldn’t believe that this was the same man who was shaken up to that degree when he was suspected of laying his hand on Agatha.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……I guess I’ll listen to what you have to say.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed Alford’s anger was just a pose to gauge their reaction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford’s attitude changed completely as though to say that he was bored by Baldr’s calmness. He urged Baldr to explain.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This kind of bargaining was completely out of Agatha’s specialty.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was only natural for someone of her position, but she couldn’t stop herself from feeling irritation and powerlessness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When she was first introduced to Baldr in this place, she swore that she would exert everything she had to help this unreliable lord.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, in reality, it was Agatha who has been helped by Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She felt happy somewhere in her heart because of that, but on the other hand she was also filled with frustration and shame that she couldn’t bear.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The family that Agatha has cut ties from sent a letter to me asking me to take Agatha as my concubine. The letter was even accompanied with an accompanying note from Count Orkney.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Strange noise could be heard from the oil painting again, but the three purposefully ignored it. How to put it, it was too flagrant that it would feel insensitive to even retort about it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There is almost no difference between having two or three concubines. It’s fine if you marry her.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「So your excellency would do that if you’re in my place?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford’s face scowled in displeasure at Baldr’s question.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Is there any idiot who would want to become related with a parasite?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s how it is. Mileton House’s aim is Antrim House’s assets. They want to make use of this relationship to take Antrim House into the faction of conservative nobles. I still don’t have the intention to be in opposition against his majesty Welkin.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「From the way you say that, it sounds like you’re going to oppose him one day.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Well, I want to get at least some payback from him one day.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The influence of blood relationships in noble society was great.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If a noble didn’t help someone despite the blood relationship between them, that noble’s evaluation would fall among the high society. He would also be considered as incompetent with managing his own clique.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was to say, if Baldr married Agatha and then abandoned Mileton House that was in danger of bankruptcy, it would become extremely difficult for Baldr to form connections with his fellow nobles.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course, it was obvious that if Baldr rejected the marriage talk with Agatha, he would be considered as disrespecting the influence of the great noble backing Mileton House and numerous nobles would break off relations with him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford also wasn’t that foolish a politician that he couldn’t see that big picture.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s why I’m asking, where is there a reason for Randolph House to have to go as far as adopting miss Agatha just to help you, lord Baldr?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford understood the objective of Mileton House and the nobles behind them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The problem was why did he have to adopt Agatha in order to protect Baldr from that scheme? It wasn’t the business of the Marquis Randolph House, a noted family that was one of the ten great nobles.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha thought that what Alford said was only natural.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For any nobles, trickery of that level was something that all of them would more or less play with. There shouldn’t be any reason at all for Randolph House to give Antrim House special treatment and save them from this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──That’s because the target of this scheme isn’t my Antrim House, but his majesty the king.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford’s eyes narrowed quietly at Baldr’s words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This kind of plot is perfectly commonplace in noble society. However, their true aim isn’t Antrim House. They are trying to reopen the war once more.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I want to refute you saying that there is no way such foolish people exist but……what is your basis of your claim?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The previous war had proved just how stupid nobles could be simply for the sake of the profit before their eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The number of noble houses that launched reckless attacks repeatedly for the sake of honor and reward only to end up losing their lives helplessly reached dozens of houses regardless of their house’s size.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If the number of retainers that were made to accompany those foolish nobles were to be included, thousands of lives were lost without any meaning at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At that time Alford was assisting his father who was still alive. He had seen so many of his former comrades fall into ruin that he got fed up with it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Does your excellency really think that Count Orkney is going to seriously back up a mere baronet house like Mileton? And is Antrim really that valuable that all the discontented nobles starting from Count Hastings will group up just to crush us?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Now that Baldr said it, that was true. Alford nodded in agreement.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Mileton House didn’t have that many connections that they could enter a faction of nobles. They were just a tiny existence that was no different from commoners when viewed from the perspective of noted families like Randolph House.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In contrast with that, although not as influential as Randolph House, Orkney House and Hastings House were also counted as noted families of the kingdom. It was too unbalanced for nobles of their status to back up Mileton House.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If it’s just as you say then, what are they trying──I see, disownment!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford deduced the answer on his own before Baldr replied.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was an old custom, where there were fewer people who remembered it than those who didn’t know of it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford accurately discerned the meaning of the unwritten law where it would be fine for nobles to not send reinforcements to a noble who they had broken off relationships with.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──How very self-centered. They are planning to use Antrim as bait to lure Haurelia!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Why did they try to entrap Antrim with this kind of scheme even though there wasn’t any considerable financial profit that they could possibly gain from it?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s status as the heir of Count Cornelius had a large meaning here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Cornelius House was the irreconcilable enemy of Haurelia Kingdom, or rather Marquis Selvi. What would happen if its heir appeared in Antrim that could be described as the frontline?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wouldn’t end with just Marquis Selvi feeling displeasure.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Such an act meant the increase of influence at the border of Cornelius House that was a prestigious military noble. At the same time, it was also like Cornelius House presenting its Achilles’ heel right in front of the enemy’s eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If it went well, it would also be possible to lure Ignis and Maggot to Antrim to save their son.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis was certainly a famous general and Maggot was a peerless warrior, but Cornelius’ army was able to fight the large army of Haurelia mostly because of the geographical advantage at Cornelius territory when they fought defensively.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What would happen if Mauricia nobles all broke off their relationships with Baldr?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Here comes a sucker just begging to be parted from his money. There was a possibility that Haurelia Kingdom would make such a judgment in front of this ideal chance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──They are like children playing with fire. They won’t understand just how dangerous it is until their clothes are caught on fire.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s pointless to expect loyalty to the country from them. They must be planning to change sides to Haurelia as soon as the situation looks bad.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「They’re going to go that far!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      I swear on my mettle as a noble that there is no such traitor in this kingdom.
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford was unable to say that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A moronic noble like Hayne might only think of everything using their own conveniences. But there was no way the mastermind behind him couldn’t notice the possibility of Mauricia Kingdom’s destruction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They wouldn’t care even if the kingdom was destroyed if it was in order to protect their own vested rights.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They were none other than parasites that were nesting inside Mauricia.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This is troublesome……even if by some chance they aren’t actually planning to involve Haurelia, there is no way Haurelia will just watch quietly without doing anything.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although the anti-king had fallen to be the minority faction right now, they still had enough strength that couldn’t be underestimated. And there was no doubt that there were traitors that would turn to Haurelia Kingdom among them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The problem was the identity of those traitors…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It will depend on which side Duke Beaufort(ボーフォート) is on.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Who was the number one among the ten great nobles at the present time? There was no need to argue about the answer. That would be the prime minister, Duke Harold Edinburgh(ハロルド – エジンバラ).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, in the past that position belonged to Beaufort House for a long time before the war.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even now the house still possessed powerful influence that surpassed Randolph House.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The current head Arnold(アーノルド) had a bad relationship with the king Welkin. He was famous as a defender of the vested interests of feudal lord nobility.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was said that his stance was greatly influenced by the death of his beloved eldest son in the war.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Arnold was already seventy years old. His successor was his grandson Austin(オースティン) who was still 17 years old. Various difficulties were expected when the head of the house was changed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The one who played the role as the educator of this Austin and also boasted to be his guardian was the vanguard of discontented nobles, Count Hastings.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The influence of Duke Beaufort who counted as Welkin’s uncle and possessed vast territory in the northern part of the kingdom was great.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If the discontent nobles gathered under him, there was no doubt that a fourth of the kingdom’s force would change sides to the enemy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……It’s not his majesty’s fault that Duke Beaufort’s son died at that time. That old man is really troublesome.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Arnold’s only son, Harry Beaufort(ハリー・ボーフォート) was someone who couldn’t be said as capable even when viewed in a favorable light.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was a man that was like the embodiment of vanity. His notable trait was how his reason for living was to gain even greater fame than the king Welkin.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps it was because of that, he unexpectedly encountered a force of the Haurelia army in the early stages of the war and died easily in battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps if fate was slightly different, it was possible that there was a future where it was Arnold who became the king and consequently Harry would be the crown prince.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If only Arnold was born three years earlier, or if his big brother the previous king, Wales died at a young age…
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was such a feeling of rivalry that drove his son to such recklessness. But Arnold was trying to forget it by hating Welkin.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wanted to think that he lost his son because he was unable to ascend to the throne.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since then, Beaufort House kept getting in the way of the various reformations that Welkin and Harold proposed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Thinking calmly, the possibility that Beaufort House wasn’t involved with this outrageous plot was low.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If Agatha is welcomed into Randolph House as an adopted daughter, I believe the number of nobles who announce disownment will be few. After all, on the surface we won’t be violating any noble customs. Of course, Count Orkney and Count Hastings will announce disownment with us, but the scale of this event won’t be at the level that will make Haurelia burst into action.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford nodded with a bitter expression at Baldr’s words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If the mastermind is Duke Beaufort, having his majesty protect you will only bring the opposite effect. It might even become a civil war if Haurelia invades at that timing.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That would be a nightmarish future for Mauricia Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If the kingdom was forced into an all-out war while the discontented nobles and the royal family were in the middle of a confrontation, it would be difficult to win the war unless a miracle occurred.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Luckily or unluckily, the previous war ended up in a draw with both sides paying a heavy price. But because of that there were a lot of nobles who were underestimating how dangerous the current situation was. That was a problem.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Besides, it was unthinkable that the discontented nobles who switched sides to Haurelia would get away unscathed after Mauricia Kingdom was destroyed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Having nobles who might turn traitor at any time would only bring great harm to the royal authority without providing even a single advantage. Haurelia Kingdom would surely search for a chance to put a false charge on them one day and purge them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was what they called counting one’s chickens before they had hatched.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However Alford knew that the number of nobles who were swayed with such over-optimistic calculation wasn’t few by any means. In the worst case, Haurelia Kingdom might even tempt Duke Beaufort with the possibility of him getting the throne to make him dance on the palm of their hand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……It’s that old man. He might be thinking that he can lead Haurelia around by the nose to obtain even better results……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「For Haurelia it will be most satisfactory already if they can just make those nobles stay positively neutral towards them, after all. They won’t hesitate to make as many empty promises as they can. From the beginning they don’t have any intention to keep those promises afterwards, though…….」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the first place, the prerequisites of both sides were different.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Haurelia Kingdom was completely serious about destroying Mauricia.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The discontented nobles who wanted to destroy Welkin and profit greatly from it were decisively lacking in such awareness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「We will lose to Haurelia if they work together with those nobles and cause an uprising. There is no doubt about it. The problem is how to not make them burst into action.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Those bunches who can only badmouth his majesty from the shadow won’t have the guts to go that far.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They would revolt only when Haurelia Kingdom’s victory was practically assured.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Besides, if they had the guts to oppose Welkin from the start, they would not need to dirty their hand with this kind of cowardly scheme.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However it was also necessary to handle the matter of Agatha carefully to not make any openings that could be taken advantage of.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Let’s return to the first question. I understand the reason why I need to make Miss Agatha my adopted child. However, that is not a reason why it has to be our house.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I guess……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr scratched his head with a troubled look while sending a glance at the oil painting.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford nodded deeply to show that he didn’t mind for Baldr to continue talking even while noticing the meaning of Baldr’s gesture.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There is still another old custom other than disownment. For example, something like how it’s allowed to send reinforcement independently in case a kinsman of the third degree is attacked by another country.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford’s face turned red in rage the instant he heard those words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You bastard! You’re planning to count on the help of Randolph House’s soldiers! There is a limit even in being conceited!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Your excellency, please think of this as a domestic military alliance with blood relationships as the intermediary. Antrim has been making preparations to give the coming invasion of Trystovy our full support.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford was honestly speechless at the attack that came from a completely unexpected direction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However he immediately recovered his composure and glared at Baldr with a sharp gaze like a hawk.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Against that intense gaze, Agatha who was nothing more than a mere young woman despite her capability was desperately stopping her teeth from clattering in fear.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Please don’t anger the marquis even more than this~~!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Alford got seriously angered, Agatha’s life would be lightly blown away like a mere feather. It wouldn’t stop there, even her innocent relatives at Mileton House might also get harmed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The marquis Alford Randolph was someone who could go that far.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Brat. I’ll praise your sharp wit for exposing this scheme just from the circumstantial evidence. However, know that Randolph House will become your enemy if I judge that there is no basis to your words just now.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford emitted a vigor and spirit that only a noted noble who shouldered the foundation of the kingdom could have.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Agatha who had only interacted with her father and brother who lacked any potential for advancement, the pressure she felt made it difficult for her to even breathe.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Your excellency, please calm yourself. Look, even that strong-minded Agatha is looking this scared……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m just a daughter of an unremarkable noble! It’s my lord who is strange that you can still stay calm like that in this situation!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha had no experience in facing an inhuman monster like Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wasn’t her fault that she was getting scared and trembling from this situation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Everything was Baldr’s fault.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Threatening you isn’t amusing at all. However, my words just now aren’t a lie, you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed his pressure just now was mostly an act. The heavy aura that Alford emitted dispersed like it had never existed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha was finally liberated from the pressure and she was able to regain her calm.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「An all-out clash with Haurelia Kingdom will only be a nightmare for your excellency who is aiming to take back Trystovy. It’s easy to see that with common sense.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Impudent talk! There is no way something like that is common sense!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     An urge to strangle the neck of the brazenly smiling Baldr ran through Alford.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Certainly, as Randolph House had Silk, the only one with the right to inherit the throne of Trystovy Kingdom, it was reasonable to think that they were aiming to recapture Trystovy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Alford didn’t have the slightest intention to use Silk as a political tool.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To be frank, he wanted to just sever relationships with Trystovy for Silk’s sake, but as he couldn’t do that, he wanted to at least reduce the risks that would endanger Silk.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford was maneuvering behind the scene to split up the duke faction of Trystovy Dukedom and lobbying many nobles to smooth over the invasion that would happen in the future.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a bitter realization to know that Baldr had learned of the movement that he did in absolute secrecy, but even more important than that, if Baldr carelessly spread this information around, it would mean wasting all the efforts that Alford had done for many years.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (How? How could this brat have learned about my maneuvers?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s discernment that could see through the plot of the discontented nobles was certainly something uncommon.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But Alford was also a first class politician. Especially when it came to diplomacy. In most cases, connections and debts that had been cultivated for many years were more necessary than talent in this field.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Baldr was able to easily grab him by the tail like this, the only possibility that Alford could think of was that he had committed some kind of fatal mistake somewhere that got him exposed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Originally someone like me who has no acquaintance in Trystovy can’t possibly learn about your excellency’s maneuvers there. But if I use a different approach, it’s not that difficult to at least find your intent.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Talk. I won’t allow you to hide anything.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alfred’s tone sounded like he would kill Baldr if he didn’t talk. Baldr only smiled wryly with aloofness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha’s heart jumped in her chest seeing Baldr’s composed bearing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if she searched the whole Mauricia, she wouldn’t find ten people who could receive Alford’s serious gaze head-on like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed that it wasn’t just Baldr’s knowledge and martial art that were outside of the norm.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (But──it’s because my lord is like this that it’s so pleasurable to bully him!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr felt a chill running through his spine. He continued his words even while feeling puzzled by the feeling.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I don’t have any connections with the nobles at Trystovy, or even any spies or intermediaries there. That’s why I don’t know what kind of measures your excellency has been preparing there but……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter how abnormal Baldr was, Trystovy was just too far.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr had only just become a viscount of a remote territory. Only stupid and puny nobles would bother to make any time to deal with a foreigner of such status.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But for the people of a certain sort, Baldr was a VIP who they mustn’t turn into an enemy no matter what.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──There is a lot of money moving hands to several Trystovy nobles in the archduke faction. They’re a bunch without any patience, that’s why they immediately attempted to exchange the money into promissory note.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For general trading companies like Dowding Company for example, it was normal for them to use promissory note for payment of foreign trade.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was dangerous and inefficient to walk around carrying a lot of cash in hand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was a close mutual relationship of complementation between companies when it came to the circulation of money and goods and foreign exchange. Naturally, Dowding Company had deep knowledge about the payments that were carried out there.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then, Baldr and Selina were close to the fourth department of Dowding Company that was supervising such information.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Those stupid pigs. Even though I had stressed so much how it would be suspicious if they suddenly throw money around……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「They just wanted to convert the money immediately and feel self-satisfaction. It seems they’re quite cornered right now.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the first place, Trystovy was operating using the tax yields from the business transactions from many merchants, and yet the archduke faction turned those merchants into enemies in the civil war. Many of the nobles of the archduke faction were destitute right now. There were even some among them who regretted joining hands with the archduke.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was the reason why Alford didn’t think that regaining Trystovy was just a pipe dream.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Weapons are also being sent to the merchants of port city Mulberry. And it seems there were military personnel who had received formal education being dispatched in order to training the militias.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Are the lips of merchants actually that loose?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford sighed in exasperation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It had been exposed this completely, to the point that it felt foolish to even try to hide it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had never considered it before, but he had to think of countermeasures if this much information was leaked from the merchants.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「They will keep their promise if they are given hush money. But the flow of money is the only thing that cannot be falsified. After all, their reputation is assured exactly by money.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was nothing more pitiful than a merchant without money. To have no money and being unable to do any transactions was like a fish stranded on land.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Exactly because of that, they were an existence that was always loyal toward money.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「In other words, my awareness has been insufficient, huh.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’d still believe that your excellency is doing such a thing even if I have no information at all about it. There is no way that your excellency won’t try to take back Trystovy before Silk reaches the age where she will have to bear the full brunt of it.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Another banging sound came from behind the oil painting.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford glared at Baldr with a face that looked like he had bitten a sour grape because of a matter that he didn’t want anyone to know about.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He finally realized the reason why just now Baldr was concerned with the person who was behind the oil painting.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──It’s my defeat. I’ll welcome Miss Agatha as an adopted daughter of Randolph House just as you asked. Though of course, it will only be as a daughter who doesn’t have any inheritance rights.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「My deepest thanks, your excellency.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr let out a sigh of relief because he had won this dangerous bet. But then Alford made a mean-spirited gaze.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wasn’t good to say this, but Baldr was taking the depth of the malice in noble society too lightly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That might be because Baldr’s true nature as someone virtuous, but if he stayed like this, he would get tripped up by that malice one day.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Seeing that I will become Agatha’s father, there is no way I can let my daughter stay in a dangerous place like Antrim. I guess I’ll have Agatha stay behind here.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What-?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was flustered by Alford’s completely unexpected words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Agatha was a completely indispensable person for Antrim House.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was why Baldr was asking for Alford’s help like this, and yet it would be putting the cart before the horse if Agatha was taken away by Randolph House.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph, I’m satisfied just from being able to see that face. However, to be frank, the best I can do in case Antrim gets dragged into war is only to take Agatha back home.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if it was the custom of nobles to dispatch soldiers for the sake of saving their son or daughter, it still didn’t change the fact that doing that would disturb the order of the kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A befitting pretext would be necessary in order to justify going as far as dispatching soldiers independently.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If you’re seeking for a concrete military alliance between us, then just making Agatha my adopted child won’t be enough. You should marry Agatha as my adopted daughter.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Crash, bam!*
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The sound of something falling from a high place to the floor came from behind the oil painting. Right after that there was the sound of a door being opened loudly and it was followed by the sound of feet stamping noisily through the corridor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Otou-sama! What are you saying!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Silk appeared while breathing hard. For an instant Alford wondered if he had raised her wrong while he spoke to her with a cold tone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I meant what I said. What is it that you are opposing? This is the best choice to accomplish you and your late mother’s dearest wish.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「B-but then, what about Agatha-oneesama’s own will……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Do you think that a girl whose life is targeted by her family has any room to be picky? If you think that you can prepare an even better candidate for marriage than this for Agatha, then tell me. However, if you can’t, then don’t say anything.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her father’s uncompromising words told how her words wouldn’t be able to reach her father no matter how much she opposed this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Silk turned her gaze toward Baldr looking for help, but her expression froze in disappointment seeing how he only looked down with his fist clenched.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「N-no way……!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Tears unconsciously leaked out from her eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was unable to spurn her father’s demand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She understood that clearly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Silk turned around on her heel and rushed out of the room to escape from Baldr and Agatha.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You made use of me, your excellency……!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You are trying to make use of me as well, aren’t you? Or perhaps, are you saying that lord Baldr will marry Silk and succeed this Randolph House?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford calmly received the hateful gaze of Baldr that was even filled with killing intent.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That girl too should abandon her lingering attachment to you too already. There are things that you will inevitably lose as the price of chasing your dream. If she doesn’t have the intention of forsaking the will that her mother left behind, what is she going to do if she doesn’t have the resolve to discard one or two loves? Or perhaps, are you saying that there is a choice where everyone can be happy without sacrificing a single thing, brat?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
<img src="img/223.jpg"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Mankind wouldn’t experience war if there was something so convenient.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Alford was completely correct.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr had faintly noticed Silk’s feelings. But he was lacking in capability and resolve to make that come true.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, Baldr had to say this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Something that is impossible today might not stay impossible in the future. I absolutely won’t give up searching for even better choices for the sake of my important companions.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Big words. Then come again when you have this so called choice that can convince me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The current Baldr didn’t have anything to say to that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Silk leaped to her bed while crying. She kept crying for a while.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was feeling a bottomless despair that felt like the ground she had been standing on until now had crumbled, causing her to be swallowed into an abyss. It made her aware of just how attracted she was to Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And she once more realized why she was able to always watch like an outsider even with the engagement of Seyruun and Selina right before her eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──There was a fate that wouldn’t let Silk and Baldr marry.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was simply averting her gaze from that conclusion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the very least she was able to dream that there might be a possibility of her getting married with Baldr while she was averting her gaze like that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her father was rebuking her because she kept acting by halves like that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Silk was someone who shouldered the future of Trystovy, while Baldr was the heir of Cornelius House that was the cornerstone against Haurelia Kingdom. If she thought it through, there were insurmountable obstacles for them to marry due to political reasons and differences in social status.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wasn’t like a marriage between an only son and an only daughter never happened in noble society.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However in such a case, the two would need two children as heirs. One of the children would be adopted by the other house to be heir.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Until the second child was born, the house that gave away their heir as bride or groom would stay heirless.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course in the case that the pair couldn’t produce more than one child, the house without an heir would become discontinued or they would need to adopt a child from another house to be the heir.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Randolph House that was one of the ten great nobles, and the Cornelius House that was a cornerstone in Mauricia’s national defense weren’t so trivial of houses that it could be permitted for them to be in such an unstable situation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In addition, there was no way King Welkin would allow such a risky situation where there was a chance that one of the two houses would become extinct.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all, both houses were indispensable existences in the political and military scenes of Mauricia Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (That’s why, I can only give up.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Yes. Hadn’t she also arrived at that conclusion in the day when she sent Agatha off to Antrim?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But, perhaps──if it was Baldr then perhaps, he might manage it somehow.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She knew she should just let go already, but even now Silk was unable to throw away such sweet expectations.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She didn’t know that she was a woman who was this frail and foolish.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I’m sorry, Otou-sama……just a bit more……give me just a bit more time……)
