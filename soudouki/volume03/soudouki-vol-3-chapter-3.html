   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 1
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr wiped his forehead that was sweaty from the strength of the blazing sunlight and narrowed his eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Amazing……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The ocean that spread out endlessly, the transparent surface of the water that was characteristic to a southern country, the colorful fishes that sometimes came into view.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Baldr who was raised in the mountain region that was Cornelius, his first voyage was enough to make his young heart dance in spite of his knowledge..
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m impressed you aren’t seasick, boy.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca planned to make fun of Baldr if he got seasick and went pale, but she shrugged her shoulders seeing her expectation was betrayed and tapped Baldr’s shoulder.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s because my semicircular canals had been trained a lot since a long time ago.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──Mainly by his mother’s training.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Semicircular……what?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Damn it. Urraca wouldn’t get it even if he mentioned semicircular canals. Baldr shook his head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「In other words, I’m used to shaking.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Well, if you claim you can do something about Sanpaniradeon without even being able to board a ship, then that would just be a dream within a dream.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca nodded to herself as though saying that being able to board a ship without getting seasick wasn’t a big deal.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because she was folding her hands in front of her chest, her splendidly protruding huge breasts were emphasized and Baldr awkwardly averted his gaze.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was dressed in a blouse that was largely opened at the chest area, a leather waistcoat that was tied with string, and a tight leather trouser that exposed her sexiness. Her appearance was suggestively sexy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was only her wide-brimmed hat that made her look like a female captain. It suited Urraca’s black hair.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Selina fell behind by a level against such a criminal body figure, while Rorona, the older girl who was Selina’s right hand could just barely rival Urraca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr imagined the resentful faces of Selina and Seyruun and he shook his head to free himself from his desire.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The ship that Baldr and Urraca boarded sailed from Cadiz and headed straight to the west through Marmara Sea.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The type of ship that was mainly used by Majorca Kingdom’s navy would be called a carrack ship on Earth. It had a shape that seemed to be combined with the traits of clipper ship.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a ship with a high oceanic navigational ability that was a characteristic of Majorca Kingdom that had a long ocean trade route. The stability of the hull was high. It was using three masts and four types of sails to receive the wind, so its flexibility was high with excellent sailing ability.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     On the other hand, because the hull was increased in size, it also had weak points like being unable to perform a tight turn when changing course and was weak against strong storm-like winds.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Those weak points immediately came to the forefront, especially when facing Sanpaniradeon pirates that were mainly using caravel ships. This type of ship used a lateen sail and its size was smaller than a carrack ship, which made its speed faster.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although Urraca claimed that they wouldn’t lose if they fought head-on, it was difficult to capture the pirates when they ran away.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The pirates would attack like hungry wolves if they thought they had superior fighting strength, but if they thought that they were at a disadvantage, they would use that speed to run away.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was really a pirate-like tactic. The navy of Majorca Kingdom had to constantly assign the majority of their fighting strength in order to guard their merchant ships in the face of this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although they had an alliance with the Sanjuan Kingdom, this burden was bigger than imagined in this situation, where they didn’t know when a naval battle with Trystovy Dukedom would break out.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「We’re going to enter those guys’ hunting ground soon. Be careful so you don’t fall into the sea at least. There are a lot of sharks around here, so there’s no guarantee you’ll keep your life even if you can swim, you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca tried scaring Baldr with her words, but he didn’t look scared at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He hadn’t been given such a soft training that he’d be unable to keep his balance and fall into the sea, and even if he fell into the sea, he could escape at any time if he used magic. Shark couldn’t use cancel magic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Thank you very much for your warning.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He could protect himself. Baldr’s words were implicitly filled with such meaning. Urraca smiled sarcastically at that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She wondered how much of his words would just be a bluff when the real battle started. It was obvious that she was harboring such doubts.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──It was at that timing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Two o’clock forward! A platoon of carrion class is approaching!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Carrion class was the medium size fast ship that Sanpaniradion mainly used. Four ships often acted together as a platoon.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Those guys are heading this way, yeah?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Their side only had one ship, the battleship La Mancha.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was only natural that the enemy was thinking they could win if they attacked with four ships.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course, it was a different matter whether their thinking was right or not.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph, I only planned to scout with a guest today but──ain’t no way I can show my back to an approaching enemy.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca drew out her sword happily and roared.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You bastards! The sail preparation is finished already ain’t it!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The rowdy sailors responded with delighted voices. All of the men here were tough nuts who loved boarding a ship and fighting more than three meals a day.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Alcohol and sail are seaman’s glory y’know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You said it!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「…………Yikes, all these people are warmongers.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr, who was often surrounded by these people of the same type, sighed at his fate of getting dragged into this kind of thing just like usual.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The battleships of Sanpaniradeon that were superior in speed split into two groups to surround La Mancha from both sides.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Urraca wasn’t so kind as to simply watch that quietly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca made a smile that was the exact picture of a predator in the hunt of prey. She licked her crimson lips.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hard starboard!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     La Mancha changed course to the right with nimbleness that didn’t suit its huge body.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanpaniradeon’s ships that planned to surround the sluggish battleship reacted lately at that unexpected movement.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Mizzen spanker haul out! Let the stern cruise. All hands, brace for impactttt!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You’re joking!? We’re going to collide!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     La Mancha suddenly dared to tackle the enemy ship. Baldr reflexively screamed seeing that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hah! What is a little collision? It’s their fault for getting close!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca let out a smile of satisfaction from finally being able to make Baldr lose his calm. It seemed she had been very conscious about Baldr without her even noticing it herself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Main and upper topsail, aback. Put a brake on ittt!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Bam* A heavy impact was transmitted to the floor under Baldr’s feet. The impact was far smaller than he expected. It must be because of the height of the sailors’ skill that drastically reduced the ship’s speed in one go.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The poor victim of that intimidating ship handling technique was one of Sanpaniradeon’s consort ships that was approaching from the starboard.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That ship turned their rudder toward their port to dodge the sudden change of direction of La Mancha, exposing their lurching hull which was completely defenseless.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The solid stern of La Mancha that was specially made collided right there.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because the lurching of the hull crossed its stability limit, the ship immediately capsized with ease. Baldr was watching that in disbelief.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A carrack ship that didn’t have a ram installed on it in order to open a hole in an enemy ship’s hull was displaying this kind of violent divine feat. It was something that his mind found hard to believe.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That cheeky little……! You bastards, don’t let them go home alive!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even after being shown such masterful ship handling, the enemy got blood rushing into their head instead. That might be just be how a sailor is. The remaining three ships threw some nets and they fiercely attempted to board La Mancha for hand-to-hand combat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Obar(オバル)! I’ll leave the ship’s command to you. The rest of you, follow me!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oooo!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca and her men joyfully went to the enemy ships with lively roars.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Boy, offense or defense, which one are you going to pick?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr shrugged at Urraca’s teasing. Even after all this, he couldn’t bring himself to dislike this woman.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wondered why he had been fated to keep encountering this kind of woman.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Naturally, I shall accompany you to attack.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Both sides followed the ropes and began fighting man to man. The enemies were trampled one-sidedly by Urraca and her men.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The enemies are few! Surround and push them back!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hah! Don’t think you can surround me above a ship!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca was running around above the deck’s unstable floor as though she was flying.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her subordinate sailors were also used to fighting aboveship. They were defeating the enemy sailors one after another with footwork that didn’t look unsteady at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Now then, what about that boy……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca believed that it would be difficult for a lander to fight on sea, and yet she saw something unbelievable there.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Despite the shaking ship, Baldr cut down three sailors that he passed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Be careful……this guy, is toug-……!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In addition, he even cut the man who seemed to be the captain with a single stroke. Their swords didn’t even clash against each other. Surprised gazes gathered on him from both enemies and allies.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Right now, it was Baldr who had defeated the most enemies.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was cutting down the enemy sailors with flowing movement that made even the veteran soldiers among his allies dumbfounded.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His figure that was slaughtering the enemies easily as though he was doing a dance performance looked like a legendary death god that invited the sailors to the underworld.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Now that’s shocking.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca didn’t feel like she would lose against anyone in a ship  battle, but she wondered what would happen if she fought Baldr right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca’s evaluation toward Baldr was changing from a cheeky brat to a skilled warrior who couldn’t be underestimated.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──No good! Who the hell is going to fight this kind of monster head-on!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Pull back the nettt! Open all the sailssssss!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The enemy ships scattered like baby spiders and ran away in a panic. There was no way Urraca and her men would just watch that quietly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Unfortunately, the fate of a man who laid his hand on a woman that he shouldn’t have touched is already decided.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      How pitiful……
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr swung his sword to the man who seemed to be the ship captain while feeling sympathy as though this wasn’t simply other people’s affair.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The ship captain fell wordlessly with an anguished face as though reality had betrayed him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「D-don’t kill me! I surrender!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The sailors who realized they couldn’t escape with the death of their captain started to raise their hands and surrendered one after another.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Around the same time, the enemy sailors who assaulted La Mancha were also attacked by the vice captain Obar and suffered a wretched experience.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How stupid you guys are, to attack the Tormenta Negra with only this much force!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Shit-! Too strong……is this ship a gathering of monsters!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They immediately escaped while leaving the many dead bodies of their comrades.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     One of their ships capsized while one more ship was suppressed and surrendered. They had no more chance of victory──the remaining two ships separated from La Mancha and began running away.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t let them get away! Follow them!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, once they started rushing away, capturing the light and speedy caravel ships that Sanpaniradeon used wasn’t easy even with La Mancha’s specs.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The naval battles in this world didn’t use cannons, instead ramming or boarding enemy ships for melee. It was impossible to do battle except from very close range.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The exultant mood just now had changed completely. An air of impatience and irritation was starting to drift around La Mancha.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Tsk……they’re only good at running.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was one of the reasons why Majorca Kingdom’s navy couldn’t capture the Sanpaniradeon pirates despite being their superior in fighting strength.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course Majorca Kingdom also had speedy caravel type ships, but they would be counterattacked if they moved independently, so in the end they still had to rely on working together with the big ships.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then there was another reason. It was a big problem that Majorca Kingdom’s navy had to solve.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Boy, it will be soon. Open your eyes wide and watch.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After pursuing the pirate ships for several hours.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The land of Trystovy was starting to become visible across the horizon. The weather was gradually becoming ominous too.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca called Baldr to the deck as though she had been waiting for this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was what Baldr and others were setting sail for originally.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then, the destination of those ships is the enemy’s stronghold?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yes……it’s the graveyard of sailors. It’s also the residence of the lightning god, the entrance of Akaba.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr gulped.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was a sinister atmosphere over there that was worthy of that ominous name.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The weather was rapidly worsening as they got closer. The sky was completely filled with black clouds of low altitude.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This is as far as we can go. It’ll be dangerous for our ship to head further.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca scratched her glossy black hair with an awkward face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You’ll see it soon, the hammer of Akaba.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If only this didn’t stand in their way, Urraca would’ve already attacked there by now. She glared at the clouds that were turning even darker.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two ships of Sanpaniradeon were getting farther, as though they were being sucked into the darkness. Then a streak of lightning violently assaulted from above.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ah!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr who felt how the lightning had fallen just now spontaneously raised his voice.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the two ships were continuing to advance as though nothing had happened.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Then several more streaks of lightning fell, as though the two ships angered the sea god
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Lightning kept falling in succession even after that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s eyes widened like a saucer seeing that unrealistic sight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Dozens of lightning bolts covered the sky. It was a menacing natural phenomenon that was unfolding in 180 degrees, forming a great panorama. Anyone who saw this would be unable to stop themselves from being clutched by their primitive fear.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But Baldr, no, Masaharu knew about this phenomenon.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was a similar natural phenomenon like this on Earth, where Masaharu lived in the past. What was it called again?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Masaharu’s eyes were stolen by that sublime sight while also muttering in admiration from the bottom of his heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『This is the same thing as the Lighthouse of Maracaibo!』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
<img src="img/143.jpg"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──Lighthouse of Maracaibo. There was the Maracaibo Lake in the northwestern regions of Venezuela, with the Catatumbo River flowing into the southwestern portion of the lake. A singularity phenomenon of lightning was occurring near the mouth of this Catatumbo River.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Lightning mainly occurred in Japan from April until November, but lightning was generated in this place for almost the whole year at an absurd number.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The Lighthouse of Maracaibo even left a Guinness book record for the highest rate of lightning, at a rate of 3600 in one hour.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Every year there would also be casualties from the lightning strike. Even modern science couldn’t completely understand how this phenomenon could occur.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was named the Lighthouse of Maracaibo because in the Middle Ages when there was no GPS and radar, this phenomenon served as a lighthouse for the sailors, functioning as a landmark.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To think that he would be able to see a similar phenomenon in another world──.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Mara……caibo? What’s that?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca tilted her head at the word that Baldr unconsciously said.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr noticed that he had unconsciously muttered a word from Earth and scratched his head with a wry smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Actually, I know another place where lightning falls throughout the year like that. That place is called Maracaibo.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I didn’t know that there is another cursed land like Akaba out there.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca noticed something after saying that and her face broke into a smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That means, there is something we can do about that annoying lightning, right?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca’s personality that was straightforward for better or worse felt very charming for some reason. Baldr stared at her with a warm smile as though he was watching a younger girl.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca’s chest thumped in response to that affectionate smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (W-what? Suddenly my breathing is──)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For some reason, she was finding it harder to breathe after seeing Baldr’s smile, but Urraca interpreted it as her excitement that a chance to defeat her old enemy had finally arrived.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps this was a part of the unfortunate reason why a beauty like Urraca was still unmarried.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Of course. The legend of Akaba’s impregnability will soon be a thing of the past.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Y-yosh! Boys, we are retreating! Prepare for tacking! Port!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Port, sir!」
    </span>

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 2
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     La Mancha changed course with a splendid turn. There was a sharp gaze that was watching the departing ship.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If only that tomboy advanced for half a mile more, we will be able to capture her.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Boss, if we don’t do something soon, it’s going to be bad y’know……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sheesh, it’s because those Trystovy guys are a bunch of lazy asses that diligent pirates like us are getting the short end of the stick.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man called the boss ruffled his hair roughly in dissatisfaction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The name of this forty two year old man who was in his prime (no objection allowed) is Kailas(カイラス).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He’s the great pirate that knew everything there was to know about Marmara Sea, the boss who leads Sanpaniradeon, and he was also a military personnel who belongd to Trystovy Kingdom’s navy in the past.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the first place, Sanpaniradeon was a sea mercenary group that guarded the transport ships of prosperous merchants in Trystovy Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The group’s scale expanded and they got scouted to join the military of the kingdom. They were enticed by salary that would become higher the more capable they were. Kailas was also one of such people who was headhunted to be military personnel.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And yet, Trystovy Kingdom fell into civil war because of the coup d’etat. The environment around Sanpaniradeon changed completely from that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The civil war wasn’t so lukewarm that Sanpaniradeon would be ignored while they possessed a fighting strength that while inferior against a country was still strong enough.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When the kingdom was divided into three factions of the archduke faction (the current Trystovy Dukedom), the royalist faction, and the merchant faction, each of them started trying to bring over Sanpaniradeon that was an independent maritime force into their side.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However as a mercenary group that was hired by money, Sanpaniradeon didn’t have the slightest intention to let go of their freedom to decide their own affiliation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A mercenary group with skill that could even toy with the regular navy if they were careless and could switch sides at any time depending on the pay. What would the three factions that had continued their dispute with each other think about them?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course, anyone who wouldn’t become their ally was an enemy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At first, Sanpaniradeon was affiliated with the merchant faction that had abundant funds. When the archduke faction came to invade the port city Mulberry, they repelled the archduke’s fleet even at the cost of many sacrifices.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It didn’t matter how much the merchant faction hardened their defense with their abundant money, because they were depending on maritime trade, they would be inevitably driven to death from emaciation if the control of the sea was taken away from them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In other words, it could be said that Sanpaniradeon had made the biggest contribution in maintaining the merchant faction’s independence.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But when the state of the war fell into a stalemate, the number of nobles of the archduke faction and merchants of limited loyalty who explored the possibility of compromise with each other increased. It was making the situation complicated.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A tragedy was then visited upon Sanpaniradeon..
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The president of Damos company, one of the largest companies that could even be counted among the top ten of merchant faction, died a sudden death. The heir then inherited the company as the second generation president.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When the elder assembly of the merchant faction made light of him, he willfully held a grudge and plotted to switch sides to the archduke faction bearing a gift.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In exchange of being appointed as the feudal lord of Mulberry, he would offer presents to the archduke faction. A part of those present was──none other than a betrayal towards Sanpaniradeon.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The second generation president who received a secret command from the archduke faction requested Sanpaniradeon to guard a ship convoy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In a stroke of bad luck, Damos Company was an important customer for Sanpaniradeon before the second generation president’s betrayal, so the group’s boss at that time, Morgan happily accepted that request.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You can entrust them to us, president. You can feel as relieved just like when boarding a large ship. Well, our ships are also literally large ships though, hahaha!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The friendly Morgan personally joined the convoy to guard it. That became his last voyage.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The second generation president secretly leaked the sea route of Sanpaniradeon’s convoy. He didn’t stop there and also colluded with the Trystovy fleet to attack Sanpaniradeon from behind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Caught betweenthe betrayal of the client and ships that they thought as allies and should be protected, it was impossible for Sanpaniradeon to endure no matter how skilled they were as sailors.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The Sanpaniradeon fleet that guarded the convoy was tenaciously attacked and not even one of them was left alive.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This tragedy on the sea wasn’t witnessed by anyone. But it was still told to Kailas who was one of the leaders at that time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The one who told him was Tolpa, the beloved hawk of Morgan.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From the hastily scrawled letter that Morgan told Tolpa to bring, Kailas learned the truth of the situation and he was furious.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He immediately led the fleet under his command and assaulted Damos Company. He didn’t listen to any question or justification to him and slaughtered the president along with his wife and children with no question asked. He also burned all of the company’s ships, warehouses, and shops to the ground.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His rage was also pointed towards the merchant faction that produced the traitor. Kailas and those who supported him used Akaba as their base and completely became independent as pirates.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The merchant faction hurriedly apologized to him and offered a great amount of money that would blind anyone’s eyes. However, only about twenty percent of the whole fleet made peace with the merchant faction and remained in Mulberry.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since then, Kailas led the reborn Sanpaniradeon and rampaged everywhere as he pleased among Trystovy, Majorca, and Sanjuan.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Even so, it’s a bit troublesome to face that Tormenta Negra on the open sea.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Actually, Kailas rated Urraca’s fleet commanding ability higher than anyone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although he once made her taste defeat in the past, that victory was more like a fraud where he made use of their difference in experience. Against Urraca right now who had become the navy minister of a kingdom, he wouldn’t be able to lose against her as the stronger opponent.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If only Trystovy Dukedom’s navy was more energetic, both Majorca and Sanjuan wouldn’t have any spare energy to care about Sanpaniradeon. However, since Trystovy Dukedom’s fleet tasted a painful defeat that one time, it seemed they changed priority to maintaining their fleet and didn’t have any intentions to do battle at all outside of extraordinary circumstances.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because of that, Urraca’s sight had been locked on Sanpaniradeon all this time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, if they kept shutting themselves in Akaba like this, his comrades wouldn’t be able to make a living.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas was in a position where he had to make a decision to commit to a decisive battle or make peace with the enemy somewhere down the line.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph, those lots at Trystovy will only rejoice if we were to be defeated by Majorca.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Their ulterior motive must be to wait until Sanpaniradeon and Majorca Kingdom took each other down before they came and mobbed up the survivor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The reason for him not surrendering to Majorca and Sanjuan even though he could read Trystovy’s intention was solely because of Sanpaniradeon’s disposition that cherished freedom, and also because of his fear toward the betrayal that happened in the past. It weighed on him like a curse stabbed into his heart, like a needle that was impossible to pull out.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Good grief……Old man Morgan, this burden is too heavy for me……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 3
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They arrived at Parma Port, which was the base of Majorca Kingdom’s navy and also Urraca’s territory. As soon as they arrived, Baldr was pushed down by the bloodshot Urraca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「And, what should be done now? What should we do so we can attack that Akaba? What should I do so I can teach that shitty bastard a lesson?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Calm down, first please calm down! Someone stop herrrr!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fuuuuuh! Fuuuuuh!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Are you an excited boar-!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The disappointing feeling that Baldr felt from Urraca’s behavior was staggering, due to a great beauty like her acting like this. Baldr tore her off from himself and tidied up his messed up hair.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t tell me, you’re going to tell me now that actually it’s impossible? If you actually say something like that to me at this late hour, I have the confidence I’ll snap completely.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please don’t snap! Well, I won’t say it’s impossible but……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, Urraca’s enthusiasm for this matter was abnormal.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The vice captain Obar must have noticed Baldr’s puzzlement. He told him the answer with a wry smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s because the opponent is the only one who gave the miss a black mark in her record. They had also fought several more times after that, but each time they would get away just like what you saw before, so her stress has been accumulating all this time.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That wasn’t a defeat! I told you I never losttttttt!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Miss……don’t say something so unsightly yeah.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ugugugu……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca sulked while gritting her teeth. It seemed she really couldn’t stomach the idea of losing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Eeeii! Enough with that and talk already! How can we invade Akaba?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Realizing that she was at disadvantage, Urraca returned to her first question once more.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──In short, we should just do something about the lightning right?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If such thing is possible.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Certainly those countless lightning strikes were stunning, but as long as they could defend against those, it wouldn’t be impossible to do battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course, the enemy had the home ground advantage, and it was extremely difficult to sail a ship under bad weather, but the Majorca fleet would manage somehow with their skill.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the end, the only problem was the lightning.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「In that case it’s not that difficult of a problem. Just have the fleet install a lightning rod and it’s done.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Lightning rod?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca tilted her head at those unfamiliar words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The gap from her appearance of a beautiful young lady and her girlish gesture was quite charming.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The one who discovered that lightning was electricity was a scientist in the eighteenth century, Benjamin Franklin.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He flew a kite inside a storm and proved that there was electrification within the thunder cloud, but this was a dangerous experiment so all of you good kids out there mustn’t imitate this no matter what.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After that, he elucidated the nature of lightning and invented the lightning rod. This lightning rod wasn’t for evading lightning but instead to guide it. It was a mystery why it was named as ‘hiraishin’ in Japanese, which had the meaning of lightning evasion needle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The lightning rod’s structure itself was extremely simple. By guiding the lightning strike to hit a metal protrusion and then guiding it to the ground, the building would be protected.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In case of a ship, the sea itself would act as the ground, so there wouldn’t be any problem if the electricity was just guided to the sea.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In reality, the power of lightning was terrifying. If it struck the ship’s mast directly, the ship would inevitably go up in flames and be destroyed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps the ship wouldn’t sink if it was lucky, but a ship that had its mast rendered useless would become a sitting duck.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca’s expression was very doubtful and she narrowed her eyes at Baldr’s explanation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Can lightning really be blocked with just that?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m not lying. I’ll be torn limb to limb if you found out that I’m lying about this, right?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Certainly, I’ll cut up your body bit by bit for fish feed if you’re lying.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Thank you for the concrete example……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There Obar’s face turned glum.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even so, our fleet will be annihilated in case this method doesn’t work. I really want to believe you boy but, if there isn’t any guarantee at all……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What Obar said was also reasonable.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This lightning rod was planned for use when attacking Akaba, so in case it wasn’t working, then Majorca navy’s main force would fall into danger.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What then? Don’t tell me you want to go to Akaba with only one ship just for an experiment? There is no way we can do that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca bit her thumb in irritation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She wanted to settle her debt with Sanpaniradeon as soon as possible.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When she was still inexperienced as a sailor and as a warrior, she was driven into a complete defeat by Kailas. Defeating him was a path that she had to walk in order for her to become an adult in the truest sense.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I also don’t want the information of us obtaining the lightning rod to fall into Sanpaniradeon’s hand……is there no royal court magician who can use lightning magic in Majorca or Sanjuan?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s a different matter if it’s the four main elements, but when it comes to lightning magic……no, come to think of it, there is just one person.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There were a lot of users of great magic of earth, water, fire, and wind, but composite magic like lightning or snow couldn’t be used besides by a special person like a royal court magician.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed there was only one person like that in Majorca Kingdom, because this country couldn’t be described as advanced in magic even as flattery.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then can we request that person to do this experiment?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 4
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then after waiting for three days, that person finally arrived.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Why is her majesty the first queen of Sanjuan here!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (There is a limit even in being unexpected……!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No no, Maria-nee is nicknamed as the heaven-sent child of the sea god. After all, she is the number one genius magician since the founding of Majorca and also the priestess of the sea. The impetus of Maria-nee’s marriage with Carlos also began when she was dancing the priestess’s ceremonial dance for the sea god festival. He fell in love with her at first sight watching her dance.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though it was a story about Maria, Urraca was talking proudly with a puffed up chest like it was about herself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sheesh, Urraca! How can you talk about such old story to a guest…….」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria blushed while hitting Urraca’s firm belly with a punch that was backed by the twist of her waist. Her face kept smiling throughout it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Gofuuh!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca who got her stomach hit by a full powered body blow bent forward and she writhed in pain.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Err, the impression I got from her is completely different from when we met before though……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Actually, this is the lady priestess’s true personality──how should I say it, she has a fear of strangers.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Obar shrugged with a sigh.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca rolled around on the ground while grinning mischievously.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It seems she is wearing sheep’s clothing when at the palace, but if you mentioned the name of Iron Fist Maria, even a crying child will shut up……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Geez, Urraca you tattletale-! Punishment for you!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Gefuuuuh!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ah, she flew in the air while somersaulting three times.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To think that Queen Maria who looked so docile and fragile could be this kind of tomboy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Say……please keep what you saw just now a secret from Franco and Pedro okay? If not then I’ll……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria clenched her fist strongly. Baldr raised both his hands in surrender.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Of course, I’ll never mention this to anyone!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──I see, I just need to make lightning strike that ship.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria looked up at an old carrack ship that was installed with a lightning rod. Then she slowly stretched her petite body.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Though she was going to do magic instead of physical exercise after this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Descend, the iron hammer of heaven──Volt!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Together with a dazzling flash, the lightning struck the lightning rod without any erring.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then the lightning energy that struck the lightning rod passed through the route that was guiding it to the sea and it was safely dispersed inside the sea.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was just the natural result following the fundamental law of the world, but Baldr spontaneously patted his chest in relief.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca stared at the ship that was completely undamaged with a shocked expression. After she confirmed that it wasn’t an illusion, she raised her fist and exploded in joy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「YOSHAAAAAAAAAAAA! Just you wait, Kailas! I’m gonna take your head this time for sureeee! Oi boys, it’s party time! Take out all the alcohol we got!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「ALCOHOLLLL!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「IT’S PARTYYYYYY TIMEEEEEEE!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Was this joviality because they were Urraca’s underlings or because all of them were sailors?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aalcohol♪Aalcohol♪」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria joined her hands together in front of her chest while skipping around in excitement.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Your majesty, just why are you looking that happy……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No good, it felt like he would become unable to trust women like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The party became really lively.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca’s tension was especially at its peak. She danced with the sailors, then she drank rum right from its bottle heartily, and then she came at others to urge them to drink some more.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was Baldr who became the greatest victim of this troublesome urging.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Drinkkkkk! Drink more! Drink until you puke!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Wait……I’m still underage──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Are you saying you won’t drink my rum!? I’ll shove it down your throat even if it’s by force, oraaa!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr already emptied five bottles and couldn’t drink anymore. He desperately resisted but Urraca forcefully grabbed his cheeks and acted roughly by trying to give him the rum mouth-to-mouth.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Nnnnnnnnnn!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Stop! I have my wives(fiancée) back home waiting for me!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For good or bad, Urraca seemed to reach her limit there and she leaned on Baldr’s chest limply. She then fell asleep with a peaceful sleeping face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This is my first time seeing Urraca-chan this defenseless.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria peered into Urraca’s sleeping face affectionately and smiled. She was also really drunk right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the very least she should have drunk as much as Urraca or even more than that, but her face only looked slightly flushed. Other than that there was almost no change from how she usually looked. Just how strong was she with alcohol?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    「Just as you know, Urraca-chan’s father died when she was little, after which she was then raised by her grandfather. Because of that she grew to become a slightly
    <ruby>
     unique
     <rt>
      grandfather complex/jijicon
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    girl. This is the first time Urraca is opening her heart this much toward a man that she has just met.」
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr got a bad premonition for some reason. His shoulders were shaking from a slight chill.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「And so I’ve something to ask you. While Urraca-chan is sleeping──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria’s eyes glinted and she licked her lips bewitchingly. There wasn’t any trace of the reserved good wife and wise mother from the palace in her current appearance at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Won’t you rape her?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Apologize! Apologize to his majesty Carlos and his highness Pedrooooo!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Eee~~, even though I thought that springtime has finally come for Urraca-chan tooo……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even if you talk cutely like that, bad things are still bad!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You know, Urraca-chan is really an innocent girl even though she looks like this, so when she wakes up in the morning and realizes what happened, I think she will become really putty-like relatively quickly. How should I say it……those who dare, wins? Something like that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I don’t get what you’re talking at all, but the you right now is just the worst!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even though I’m just thinking of Urraca-chan’s happiness!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「In what world is there someone instigating a man to rape her sister because she is thinking of her happiness!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca’s hands went around to Baldr’s back and hugged him tightly while the two were having such an argument. She was turning him into her pillow.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Nn……Ojii-samaaa…….」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca slept soundly on Baldr’s back with a satisfied look. Maria clenched her fist once more.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Look! As I thought……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What do you mean look!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (It’s amazing that his highness Pedro can grow to become such a good child!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 5
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A squad of knights was patrolling the streets of Sanjuan Kingdom’s capital, Cadiz. They were keeping a watchful eye for anyone suspicious.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since the assassination attempt on Franco the other day, the security in the capital was kept in a state of high alert until now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A single shadow was slithering through the darkness of the night without being hindered by such security.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though the silhouette should be right there, no one paid it any attention.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was like that silhouette was invisible and didn’t exist, like a shadow that everybody would ignore.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The shadow’s true identity was Bartholomeo de Cervantes. He was the leader of the assassination attempt that the knights were currently searching for in a frenzy, although his identity still hadn’t been discovered.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Do they think I’ll be captured just from this?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo was also burning an incense that was obstructing recognition, but from the start he was already a man with thin presence.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His strong desire to kill and his murderous intent gave him a far different impression from such a thing, but if he felt like it, he could always blend into the scenery like air at any time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He evaded the gaze of the sentries and infiltrated a towering mansion at the port.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Pardon my intrusion, your excellency.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「W-who?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A voice of a man came like a whisper that was accompanied by a gust of the night wind. Santacruz felt a chill that didn’t befit this humid southern country and shivered.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s me, your excellency.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「B-Bartholomeo! You fool! Have you forgotten that I told you to go hide for a while!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Right after the assassination failed, he sent the majority of Akaishi agency’s members to the remote region where the investigation effort wouldn’t reach them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     King Carlos was angered by the assassination attempt and ordered his royal guards to apprehend the culprit, and because of that it became impossible for Santacruz to camouflage the incident. Therefore he could only do this until things calmed down.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course Bartholomeo was also perfectly aware of that, but he had something that he had to ascertain no matter what.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I heard that the military is going to switch sides to Prince Franco, is that true?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Santacruz’s complexion immediately turned pale. Bartholomeo didn’t miss it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (So, it’s as I thought──)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was half-doubting this information because it was too absurd, but he was finally convinced from Santacruz’s expression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The military was undoubtedly becoming intimate with Prince Franco, who should be their sworn enemy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo couldn’t even imagine what kind of change in the political landscape could bring about such a result. However, he was able to understand just how dangerous his situation had become from this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He and his men who carried out the assassination and were also in charge of numerous shady dealings of the military would be nothing more than nuisances for the new order.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m aware that there is such movement from a part of the military. However, as long as Duke Cordoba is still behind Prince Franco, such an idea will be nothing more than a pipe dream. There is no need for any worry.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I see. Then──the military won’t be reluctant to cooperate with Prince Franco if Duke Cordoba’s influence can be removed?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Prince Franco’s mother was the daughter of Duke Cordoba. Normally removing the influence of Cordoba House would be an improbable story because there was nobody who could rival a great noble like Duke Cordoba in this kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, it seemed there was someone who accomplished that using an unknown trick.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Foolish……such a thing is simply impossible. Return back to your hideout quickly without thinking of any unnecessary concerns.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There is nobody who can capture me secretly without anyone else finding out. As long as I’m safe, there won’t be any proof that tied me with your excellency. Please have no worries.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If his words were put another way, even Santacruz wouldn’t get away unscathed with just a single action from Bartholomeo. It was a scathing threat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s not rare for self-conceit to trip someone up. Get out quickly.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    Santacruz was already aware, but as expected,
    <ruby>
     this man
     <rt>
      Bartholomeo
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    was dangerous.
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As a matter of fact, Santacruz was in opposition to the movement of the military to support Prince Franco. However, he was also aware that if Majorca Kingdom supported Prince Franco, he wouldn’t be able to stop the military from changing sides with just his opposition alone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Prince Pedro could become a contender against Prince Franco only because the military could expect support from Majorca Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Especially the navy, because it would be very difficult to maintain their control of the Marmara Sea without the help of Majorca Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If an indispensable allied country was supporting Prince Franco, the people who were smart in finding opportunity would all decide to support Prince Franco too.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At that time it would be inconvenient if Bartholomeo was alive.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, the illegal force Akaishi agency was under the control of Bartholomeo. The pawns that he might be able to use against them were only the military’s irregular special force at best.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As expected it would be difficult to conceal it if he dispatched them──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I say, it seems I have worsened your excellency’s mood. I shall leave quickly to decrease your excellency’s worry.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo speedily avoided the gaze of Santacruz who was starting to have such dangerous thoughts and left the mansion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Things had become very annoying. With this, he would become unable to taste the joy of killing to his heart’s content.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo could carry out crimes like kidnapping, murder, coercion, and robbery without being pursued because he had the military as his backer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he turned the military into an enemy, Bartholomeo would lose the majority of his life’s fun.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He needed a new master.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A master who wasn’t too smart and would give him the authority and work that could satisfy his hunger.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Now then, I wonder if there is an employer who needs my skills.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo put his hand on his forehead while looking really troubled. From both his sides, the shadows suddenly leaped at him as though they had obtained human form.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was an attack that would completely take an average person by surprise, but Bartholomeo only smiled thinly and shook his head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He threw a knife at one of the shadows, piercing its neck.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Gah!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The shadow fell on the ground with a single cry.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The other shadow that realized their surprise attack had failed didn’t confirm his comrade’s death, running away as fast as his legs could carry him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, there was no way Bartholomeo would just silently let that defenseless back go.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……This is a method of the underworld.  Looks like the military still won’t move.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo said that and wriggled his fingers in amusement.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Then a gleaming silver steel string that had been laid out without anyone noticing followed his fingers’ movement and cut apart the shadow into pieces.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Entrails were scattered and red blood was splattered on the brick alley. Bartholomeo looked down at the assassin who died instantly and muttered.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Looks like I have to hurry……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed the underworld society that had a grudge against Bartholomeo had quickly judged that he had already lost his backer and started to move against him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 6
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmm~……I thought that he might be able to do it, but to think that he will do it this quickly.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Jose, who came leading the fleet of Sanjuan, found Baldr and waved his hand cheerfully.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course a part of him was holding hope about Baldr’s knowledge.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the opponent was the ruler of Marmara Sea, the Tormenta Negra.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She wasn’t that easy of a woman who would give her trust just because she was given the way to conquer Akaba’s lightning.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And yet Baldr was accepted on board La Mancha as though he was an old friend. It was a feat that made Jose even feel fear.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr greeted him with a smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「As I thought, you look really good aboard a ship, admiral.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I like deskwork better though.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You’re joking, admiral.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Jose wasn’t suited with physical labor, but he loved the sea. Baldr judged that this man was a genuine sailor deep inside.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, it was a magnificent sight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Jose came here leading the first fleet of the Sanjuan Kingdom’s navy. This fleet was specialized for battle and it was the core of the military.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It could be said that this fleet was occupying the majority of Sanjuan Kingdom naval battle strength.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The ship that Jose commanded was the newest type of mast ship that resembled La Mancha. It had a design that could be expected to catch wind better than a ship that was using square sails.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oo, Jose-dono. Thanks for coming!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Isn’t this Urraca-dono? My thanks for the welcome.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Jose bent his waist politely. Urraca replied to him in a good mood and hugged his shoulders.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You have aged very well, Jose-dono. I won’t be able to keep my hands off you in twenty years.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hahahahaha……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca’s jijicon was also still as usual.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「We’re going to subjugate Sanpaniradeon that is nesting in Akaba this time for sure.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca proclaimed with a rough nasal breathing. The ship captains of Majorca all nodded firmly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Just like Sanjuan Kingdom, Majorca Kingdom was also dispatching almost all of their ships that could sail the ocean. If the number of ships from both countries was combined, the fighting strength could be said as distinguished even throughout the continent.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Their blood as warriors was also aching for this fight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The feeling of wanting to join a grand fleet like this and throw themselves into a battle that would be recorded in history, even Baldr could understand such feelings well because he was born as a man.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even so, to think that lightning can be blocked with this kind of simple contraption……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Jose was deeply emotional when he looked at the lightning rod and smiled wryly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr got curious by his reaction and asked.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Is there something that concerns you, admiral……?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No, actually Urraca-dono isn’t the only one. Once I also met a painful experience because of Kailas.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wished to regain his honor one day, but to think that the chance for revenge would arrive in this kind of shape.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As long as that thunder cloud existed at Akaba, Sanpaniradeon was thought to be unbeatable.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s……worrying.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr only thought that they would be able to win as long as the lightning could be neutralized somehow, but the fact that even Jose was defeated in the past made him renew his assessment of the man called Kailas.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even without lightning, Sanpaniradeon must be a terrifying enemy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Do you know about the man called Kailas?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No……I only know that he is the leader of Sanpaniradeon.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Originally, he was a military officer of Trystovy Kingdom’s navy. If you mentioned the name of Clairvoyant Kailas, any old navy officer will know his name. Right now he has never fought properly because of his pirate business, but when there were still many skirmishes between Sanjuan Kingdom and Trystovy Kingdom, he was a really dangerous opponent.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Jose was a sailor before he was a military officer. In his words there was a feeling of respect and jealousy that couldn’t be hidden.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「So he is a man of such high caliber……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Baldr-dono, why do you think navy will be stronger the closer they are in an area near their base?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr pondered the meaning of Jose’s question.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Normally the closer the fleet was to the base, the shorter the supply line would be. Even galley ships and small ships that couldn’t sail far away to the ocean would also be able to join the battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the answer to Jose’s question wasn’t something like that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Most likely the reason Kailas was strong──was something related to the skill of the sailors.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Suddenly Baldr recalled the Battle of Dan-no-ura in Masaharu’s knowledge.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In that battle which was famous as the last battle between Genji and Heike clans, the reason that Minamoto Yoshitsune’s army that was in disadvantage could turn the table and crush the Heike force was because of the change in the tidal current.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The complete knowledge of the peculiar ocean current of the local area──and also the wind direction, is that the answer?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Jose’s thin-slitted eyes widened hearing Baldr’s answer. Then he chuckled in surrender.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m glad that you’re an ally. If I have to turn either you or Kailas into enemy, I’ll undoubtedly pick Kailas.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wondered how Baldr who wasn’t even a navy could understand the concept of home turf advantage in the ocean that could be said as a top secret knowledge. Including the matter of lightning rod too, this young man had something in him that made him even felt it was stupid to keep getting shocked by what he did.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The reason Kailas is nicknamed as Clairvoyant is because of his genius in reading the flow of wind, that’s all there is to it. With him as the opponent, even fighting within the home turf of our ally won’t be an advantage.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Jose was still a mere ship captain, he was chasing after Kailas’s ship in an area that he was familiar with. He grasped the flow of wind and closed the distance, but then because of the low atmospheric pressure the wind blew to a completely different direction and he failed to seize the wind. His ship was then sunk by Kailas.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The fact that he was still alive right now was simply of his good luck that there was an allied ship that happened to pass by.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For a sailor to lose against the enemy in reading the wind within his own turf was simply a disgrace.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──I have to pay back Kailas this time for sure. Because of that……I’m counting on you okay?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr smiled wryly. He was troubled that he got such expectations placed on him so one-sidedly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please spare me. I’m just a complete amateur when it comes to sea after all……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There are also some situations when being an amateur can be useful. Especially when facing an absurd opponent like Kailas.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Besides, this time there was also another person who he could rely on other than Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The Tormenta Negra aka Urraca de Parma. She was known as a genius in reading wind, who wasn’t at all inferior to Kailas.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To be able to participate in the battle to decide who was better between these two geniuses who were miraculously born within the same era, Jose felt an excitement in his chest that surpassed his desire for revenge.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Who would be the stronger one in the end?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The victor of this battle would become the undisputed strongest existence in this Marmara Sea.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He thought that he had grown old, but it seemed that he still hadn’t withered as a military man. Jose smiled joyfully.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 7
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s really a big mess, boss.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At Sanpaniradeon’s home turf, the report from the Hawk’s Eye that was scouting the western part of Marmara Sea had arrived. This report arrived the next day after Urraca and others set sail from Parma.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In this world where radar didn’t exist, scouting ability was extremely precious. It could be said that Sanpaniradeon had seized the initiative.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas thanked his subordinate who delivered this information to him without resting or sleeping. When he became alone, he threw his body on the floor spread-eagled.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「They really rate us highly, damn it……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The combined fleet of Sanjuan Kingdom and Majorca Kingdom was heading to Akaba right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The force that was dispatched here was unthinkable to just face pirates. It was an exaggerated battle force as though there would be battle between countries.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no doubt that they were dispatched with the recognition that Sanpaniradeon’s threat level surpassed the fleet of Trystovy Dukedom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore, the admirals in command of the force were Urraca and Jose. They were two great admirals who led the respective navy of the two kingdoms.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Their strength was the real deal. Even Kailas was honestly recognizing them as formidable foes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if he took into consideration that he would be fighting on his home turf, it didn’t change the fact that he had to face enemies that were stronger than his own army.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s a different matter if it’s just that little missy Urraca, if that bastard Jose also join in……good grief, even though we have been careful in using the secret lightning repellent……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The thing that Kailas called as lightning repellent was of course referring to the lightning rod.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was just a coincidence that he learned about the secret of the lightning rod that was used by the native people that were living at Akaba.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After destroying Damos Company, Sanpaniradeon was in need of a new base. Akaba became a candidate of that base because it completely fulfilled the requirements, except for the lightning here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, lightning was the natural enemy of a ship that was equipped with a tall mast. It was extremely unfortunate, but he thought that he had to give up using Akaba as base, and yet one of the sailors who went to investigate Akaba fell in love with a local girl and he managed to reveal the existence of the lightning repellent.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Learning that this lightning repellent could also be used at ship, the sea near Akaba became a safe home for Sanpaniradeon.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since then, Sanpaniradeon would sail fast under the lightning strikes and rampage throughout Marmara Sea while turning Trystovy, Sanjuan, and Majorca into their enemies.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Right now that situation was changing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sadly, Sanpaniradeon was nothing more than a pirate in the end. If it became a battle of attrition, they wouldn’t be able to match the recovery power of a country’s military.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even at the best of times, the cost of maintaining an existing fleet was already stupidly high, and furthermore there would also be the cost for building substitute ships if a ship was too old or broken beyond repair. A national budget would be necessary for that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In reality, the majority of Sanpaniradeon’s ships were decrepit ships that were built before the civil war. Simply winning this battle wouldn’t allow them to avoid the dark future that was waiting for them in the end.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If half of their fleet was sunken, then even if they won, they wouldn’t be able to replace the loss.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (This freedom is something that we obtained after much hardship, but even our independence might soon reach the limit huh……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Either way, they had no option of just surrendering.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     First they had to win this in order to have a better bargaining position at the negotiation afterwards, or else they wouldn’t be able to advance forward.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t think that this Clairvoyant Kailas can be stepped over that easily.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     First he had to know the opponent he fought.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The true nature of humans would be exposed on the battlefield without any way to hide it. Even if he wanted to sell Sanpaniradeon’s strength to them, he first had to know the caliber and strength of the opponents he fought.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oi! How many junk ships we have right now that cannot possibly fight?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Kailas yelled angrily like that, his close aide who was waiting at the adjacent room rushed inside.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yes, there are roughly around twenty ships.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Not enough……it’s fine even if it’s just a scrapped ship or whatever, prepare more than forty ships that can still float. The more the better.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Got it. I’ll try giving a call to the merchants too.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hurry. We don’t have any leeway to wait for the enemies leisurely, after all.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 8
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The combined fleet of Majorca and Sanjuan was cruising in front of the inland sea of Akaba.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It seems we’re already found out.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The fleet of Sanpaniradeon was waiting for them without looking flustered at all. Urraca smiled bitterly at that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The combined fleet didn’t find out about Sanpaniradeon’s monitoring at all, so the opponent must have a very good spy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca threw out her chest arrogantly at the front deck of the flagship La Mancha and laughed ferociously.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her long time sworn enemy should be this capable at least.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He mustn’t be a gutless loser dog that easily exposed his defenseless flank.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Their number is more than expected. They might have gathered everything they have.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When fighting at an inland sea like Akaba, even the slow galley and small ships could also be counted as military assets.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But in the end it was only to the degree that it was better to have them than not. Jose felt that doing this was too risky for Sanpaniradeon, who had little in the name of reserve personnel.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fufu……it’s great, the decisive battle. Fighting with everything we got until one of us stop breathing is also not bad.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca seemed to interpret this as Kailas mustering everything he had for their showdown.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「They might be suicide soldiers. Please be careful.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If the enemies launched suicide attacks with the intent to die from the start, even this combined fleet might be forced into a difficult battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Though that was only if Sanpaniradeon had that much fighting spirit. Jose was aware that sometimes soldiers who were resolved to struggle to the death could display unbelievable strength.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I don’t mind. A decisive battle will naturally include that too.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca was defeated in the past when she was still green and while she lived in disgrace, she was now in the position as the navy minister of a country.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her subordinates also respected her as their superior and thought highly of her strength.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She also obtained the nickname of Tormenta Negra and her name was quite well known throughout many countries.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But, in the end that was only the evaluation of her at the surface.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since that day when she let her subordinates die and swore to someday regain her honor, Urraca de Parma’s soul hadn’t advanced even a step forward.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If she didn’t win against Kailas today and severed the destiny between them, she wouldn’t be able to introduce herself as Urraca de Parma in its truest meaning.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Surpassing the man named Kailas was what would make Urraca to be qualified as the successor of Parma House, the family that lived on the sea.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Boss lady! The ocean current is changing!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I see.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca was measuring the timing of when the high tide rushed into the inland sea. She grinned with her canine bared.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then Jose-dono, let’s move just as planned.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Understood.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She must have felt no need to talk further than that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Jose quickly boarded a cutter boat and left La Mancha.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then Urraca sucked in air into her lungs until the limit and yelled out with fighting spirit filling her voice to the bursting.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「BOYS! OPEN ALL THE SAILSSSSSS! CHARGEEEEEE!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oo, here they come. That little miss is really in high spirit.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Majorca Kingdom’s fleet charged under the thunder cloud with magnificent ship handling. Sanjuan Kingdom’s fleet was following slightly behind them as backup.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If the fleet commanders didn’t have good coordination with each other, the rear fleet would only get in the way of the fleet that was going ahead instead of acting as backup. But there was no commander who was more suited for this duty than the intellectual general Jose.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Kazru, bloody the nose of the Sanjuan fleet. Don’t take them head on. You just need to buy us time.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man with a small build and face that was tanned from the sun and sea breezes nodded with a delighted grin.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Just leave it to me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kazru who was the number three leader in Sanpaniradeon was famous as the best in handling ships after Kailas.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was the best man to use if the purpose wasn’t to fight the enemy head on but leading around the enemy by the nose.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oi, you bastards! We’re gonna drag the face of that Sanjuan’s sissy into the sea for a bit!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aye sir!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kazru and his men also understood very well just how difficult of an opponent the first fleet of the Sanjuan Kingdom was.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They were also aware that Kailas telling them that they only needed to buy time was nothing more than a consolation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, they had the dignity to feel proud to be the ones chosen for this difficult mission.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This dignity was the very thing that pushed up Sanpaniradeon that was nothing more than a pirate group to be great pirates that could even take on countries.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Starboard!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Port!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     By chance both Kailas and Urraca turned the rudder of their ship to catch the same wind flow.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Wheel aweather! Mizzen spanker fifteen degree, haul out!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Wheel aweather! Tsk, so we fell behind!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, as expected it was Kailas who forestalled Urraca and took the upwind because he was more familiar with the wind of this area.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For sailing ships, wind was the energy that moved it. The fleet that was at the upwind would easily have better mobility than the fleet that was at the downwind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps it was alright to claim that Kailas had taken the initiative first in this battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Looks like we got outwitted right from the start but……now, how are you going to fight from there? Kailas!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The Majorca fleet that was led by Urraca was forming the single horizontal line formation. The fleet was moving orderly without the slightest disorder in its formation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It would be difficult for Sanpaniradeon to fight them head on because they were inferior in number and ship size.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But──.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「My hat’s off to the little missy’s guts but……don’t think that there isn’t anyone stronger than you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas continued to maintain a fixed distance with Majorca fleet using skillful maneuvers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Then a moment later, lightning ran through Akaba’s sky like a spider web.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Numerous bolts of lightning flashed as though cutting apart the sky. Their number was around 50.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Several of them fell in succession toward the Majorca fleet that had tall masts on their big ships.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Starboard easy.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aye sir!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s lightning rod diverted the lightning without any problem at all and the electricity was let to escape into the sea.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca rode the wind to chase after Kailas’s fleet without a single twitch in her expression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the other ship captains who had no experience of lightning falling on their ship couldn’t be as calm as Urraca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They reflexively shut their eyes from fear of lightning strike, so they were slow at turning their wheel. The sailors who were in charge of controlling the sails were also forgetting to continue moving their hands.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A large seam appeared within the formation of the Majorca fleet, which up until then hadn’t shown the slightest disorder
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hard port!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The Sanpaniradeon fleet simultaneously changed course by 180 degrees at that moment, as though they had been waiting for that opening.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Tsk! How sloppy!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca couldn’t stop herself from clicking her tongue after seeing her men’s unexpected blunder.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas swiftly changed the formation of his fleet into a two column formation. They rushed to drive a wedge into the open seam in Majorca fleet’s formation before they could fix it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Drop down the cutter! Don’t be late to run away! Set fireee!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Fire arrows were launched at the ship that was sailing at the very front right at that time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The ship must have been covered with oil beforehand. The ship was transformed into a pillar of crimson flame in the blink of an eye. The Majorca fleet became even more disordered trying to avoid the burning ship.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For a ship that was made from wood, being set on fire was completely fatal.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hard port!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Majorca fleet’s formation was splitting to the left and right with the burning ship at the center.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then Sanpaniradeon fleet that had transformed into two spears launched a pincer attack at La Mancha that was separated from its allied ships.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph, are you planning to gang up on me with that?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas’s strategy was obvious.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wanted to capture either Majorca Kingdom’s navy minister Urraca de Parma or Sanjuan Kingdom’s navy minister Jose Liberiano alive while the damage of the battle was still extremely small.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then by using them as hostage, he would negotiate a ceasefire with advantageous terms for Sanpaniradeon.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if they won, if they lost too many ships it would only make Trystovy Kingdom happy. Sanpaniradeon didn’t have the ability to replenish the ships they lost.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In order for Kailas to protect his organization while taking on the fleet of two countries, he absolutely needed to accomplish such insanely difficult conditions.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Overlap the trim! Raise the speed!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     La Mancha that was going to get surrounded accelerated to shake off the pursuers. Kaila laughed boldly seeing that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No way I’ll let you get away so easily!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fore topsail aback! Mizzen spanker haul in!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Just what are you──dammit!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas of all people noticed it too late.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He unconsciously focused on capturing Urraca too much because he let his guard down just for a bit.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Starboard!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
<img src="img/182-183.jpg"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     La Mancha changed direction, at the same time the wind suddenly blew from the east to the north.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     La Mancha seized the wind a step faster, in contrast Sanpaniradeon’s fleet was a step slower.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas’s flagship was just barely able to follow behind, but La Mancha was already turning the rudder to the opposite direction from Kailas.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Bring the ship closer! I don’t care even if you slam it!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「N-no good! We won’t make it!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     La Mancha accelerated from the strong wind as though to mock the Sanpaniradeon fleet that was trying to surround it. It leisurely passed through the small gaps between the ships.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Shit-! What a blunder……you got me there.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hah! Show off your skill if you want to catch a woman!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although he had predicted it beforehand, to capture the Tormenta Negra was an impossibly difficult feat as expected.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas’s composed expression still hadn’t crumbled, but he wasn’t that composed inside.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because he had to decide the battle before Kazru’s fleet that was holding back Sanjuan fleet was destroyed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t get carried away! I swear I’ll catch you and that’s just what I’m gonna do!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the meanwhile, Kazru’s battle against Jose was a hopeless one.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Looks like his reputation as Sanjuan’s fountain of knowledge ain’t just for show.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kazru was slightly better at ship handling.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, using the advantage in numbers and controlling the fleet logically, Jose never yielded the advantage to Kazru from start to end.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Your fleet maneuver is magnificent but……don’t think that battle is so simple you can win with just that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kazru repeatedly approached and retreated while shouldering the risk of being surrounded and annihilated. That way he was barely able to continue holding back Sanjua fleet.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course, the price of that appeared in the form of his fleet being whittled down. More than thirty percent of his ships already ended up as a wreck on the sea.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Not yet! You bastards, show them the pride of Sanpaniradeon!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oou! Just this much doesn’t even count as itchiness!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Jose scratched his head with a troubled expression seeing his enemy’s fighting spirit that was still going strong even now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Good grief, looks like I better prepared myself to get scolded by Urraca-dono later……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Both Jose and Urraca wanted to settle the debt with Kailas.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, Jose was cornering Kazru steadily with splendid tactics and low risk. He was living up to his reputation as the intellectual general who was called as the Demon of Lepanto.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What a waste is it……that I have to let a man this skilled die.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas would surely choose to surrender if he saw that he had no chance of victory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rather than fighting to the last man, he would choose to live even if he had to bear his shame.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was a man with that much discernment. Although he was also a man who would never give up while there was still a chance of victory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Jose had no doubt that it was impossible for Kazru and his men to continue escaping Jose’s attack until that time came.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Just surrender already……well, they won’t listen even if I told them that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Then he could only attack with everything he had. That was also the way he showed his respect to them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Third group, fourth group! Cut through them from eight o’clock!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aye sir!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The side that did offense or defense had switched in Kailas and Urraca’s fierce battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas had cornered La Mancha where Urraca was on board until there was just one more step left, but La Mancha got away. Because of that he had almost been captured by the Majorca fleet that had rallied back. Kailas continued to run away by making use of his superior speed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What’s the matter? It’s boring if you just keep running away!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas calmly returned a yell at Urraca’s insult.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You’re the only woman who can look good when chasing after a man’s ass!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Big talk coming from a man who try to gang on a single woman just now!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As expected, Kailas’s commanding ability was first class. Urraca was unable to catch his tail at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so if he continued to run away like this, Sanjuan fleet would soon join the pursuit too.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His fleet was already at a disadvantage right now. If he got pincered by two fleets, Sanpaniradeon wouldn’t have any chance of victory at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas wanted to settle the battle before that. Urraca also wanted to settle this without borrowing Jose’s strength.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was exactly why, throughout the offense and defense where the table might be turned at any time, the two repeatedly displayed superhuman techniques that the average sailor couldn’t even hope to imagine against each other.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For the first time since they were born, the two of them obtained the feeling that they were fighting with their whole soul as a sailor. Without intending to, the two of them were laughing loudly in joy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ahahahahahaha! That’s really something, Kailas!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fuhahahahahaha! It’s too bad you’re born as woman, Urraca!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two fleets were gradually approaching the center of Akaba’s inland sea.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course Kailas, who was going upwind, was leading the chase until this way.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was a small island called Taitikuwa slightly near the coast there. Countless reefs were stretching from that island, hidden under the water. Even for Sanpaniradeon, this area was an unnerving place to sail through.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Starboard easy! Tsk, the sea is getting damn choppy.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Lightning was dancing boisterously in the sky as usual, but in addition rain was also starting to fall. The wind was also getting stronger.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wasn’t that much of an obstruction for a sailor at Kailas’s level, but right now he wished that there would be as little obstruction as possible.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas wiped the raindrop that hit his cheek and glared at the sky.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the end, was this rain a blessing of heaven, or was it the trap of the devil──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Around the same time, Urraca noticed that she was being lured into an area that Kailas specified.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But putting it another way, this must be Kailas’s last trump card.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Kailas seriously tried to escape, Majorca fleet wouldn’t be able to capture him because their ships were inferior in speed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, if Urraca destroyed that trump card, Kailas wouldn’t have any other choice except launching an all-out attack to capture Urraca in a sink or swim gamble.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca was waiting impatiently for Kailas’s trap to activate with a silent confidence.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Cold sweat trickled from the forehead of Kailas who was staring hard at the water surface.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps this was the hardest he ever sharpened his focus when sailing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The Sanpaniradeon fleet was already approaching the very edge of the reef area.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, if he considered Urraca’s skill, he wouldn’t be able to lead her into the trap if he didn’t go this far.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……What, is this the best you can do?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca was convinced that Kailas was trying to lure her into a reef area.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (You’re completely miscalculating if you think I can only read the flow of wind.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Starboard!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If she led her fleet even just slightly outside Kailas’s route, her ships would crash on the reefs.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, she had the confidence to sail through this. If this kind of obvious trap was Kailas’s trump card, then to be honest it was just a kill-joy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No──!?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hard starboard! Topsail! Let go of the wind!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca could see the wind was whirling powerfully as though to throw the fleet toward the reef violently.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (So this is what Kailas is waiting for! This unique wind of Akaba is pushing the fleet toward the reef. But──you’re deathly wrong if you think that I’ll really fall into the trap from something like this!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Nobody in the Majorca fleet could predict this wind other than Urraca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her talent was truly a gift from heaven. The queen of the sea that was the pride of Majorca, Urraca de Parma was able to escape from this extreme danger.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──That was how it looked like
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Gakun!!*
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Suddenly there was an impact from the bottom of the ship. Urraca’s body pitched forward.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     An unpleasant cracking sound of wood breaking could be heard.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The reality before her eyes was unbelievable.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She should have dodged the reef without fail. However, the impact that was transmitted from the bottom of the ship was none other than the sign of the ship running aground.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Several more ships were also running aground behind La Mancha.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Topsail, aback! Mizzen spanker whole out! Hurry! We’re going to crash!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The ship captains behind hurriedly arranged their sail to catch the wind in reversed direction and put the brakes on the ship to avoid crashing on their allies.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Like this, La Mancha became isolated while unable to move temporarily.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Now, it’s check.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas’s ship changed course completely. He finally caught La Mancha right before his eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca de Parma was a super first class sailor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was why she believed that she could shrink the distance by sailing just barely outside the reef area.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca had the option to give up chasing after Kailas and retreat temporarily to set up another battlefield.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, her pride didn’t allow her to do that. She had to regain her honor no matter what.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca wouldn’t run away. And with her skill, even the sudden change in the direction of the wind wouldn’t disturb her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Exactly because Kailas believed that to be the case, he had sunk several large scrapped ships parallel to the reefs to create improvised reefs.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The number of ships he sank was around forty. Although all of the ships were decrepit ships that would have to be scrapped before long, for Sanpaniradeon that had few ships as replacement, that number wasn’t few at all. But that sacrifice had certainly allowed them to wrest off a great result.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas won his bet.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Throw the netttt! We’re boarding them!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      Now you damn witch, I’ll fasten the rope around your neck!
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca was dumbfounded by the unforeseen situation only for a very brief time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was angry that Kailas got her, but her excitement of being able to cross swords directly with Kailas surpassed that frustration right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Boys! It’s gonna be our win if we can hold on until our allies arrive! Don’t mess up!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanpaniradeon’s ships that were approaching La Mancha numbered three in total including Kailas’s ship.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The other ships surrounded La Mancha to act as a barrier that blocked the Majorca fleet.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wouldn’t be that difficult to crush Sanpaniradeon fleet while they were sitting duck like this, but it was unknown how long it would take to breakthrough the line while the pirates were fighting desperately to the death.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Looks like I’ll finally be able to be useful too……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Baldr, the sea battle until now was a dazzling battle between masters that no amateur was allowed to interrupt.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even in Sanai’s era, the navy bunch was a military technocrat that far surpassed the land army. It was said that to train the navy, it could easily take a few decades.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Besides, the people of the land were unable to understand the warriors of the sea at the fundamental level. Sanai was intuitively aware of that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And yet regardless of that, after being shown a battle of such magnificent skills, there was no way his warrior blood wouldn’t itch.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If it was close range combat, then even Baldr had a place to raise achievements.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The vice captain Obar tapped at Baldr who was gripping his sword tightly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This is gonna be a bit hard, but I’ll count on you. This time our opponents are gonna be tougher than the small fries from the other day.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Actually, this wouldn’t be merely a difficult battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The marines who were on board La Mancha were first class, but the specialized attack squad that Kailas was leading──nicknamed Black Orca was even more famous.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca believed that their strength was around equal, but her subordinates on board of La Mancha, the flagship of Majorca Kingdom navy had no experience of fighting as the disadvantaged side.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (What will be the result from that difference in the end……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Secure the net! Anchor let go. You guys got it? Don’t show a fight that’s gonna shame you to your comrades!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ooo!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas’s subordinates responded to his encouragement.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They knew more than anyone just how much sacrifice had been paid by their comrades in order to create this chance. And then if they couldn’t capture Urraca here, all those sacrifices would become pointless.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fire!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Arrows were fired by La Mancha’s archers together with Obar’s order. Several pirates fell to the sea.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The possibility of getting saved was small if one fell into the sea under this stormy weather with roaring thunder.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Kailas and his elite subordinates, the Black Orca, didn’t even glance at their falling comrades and continued climbing the net to La Mancha.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t falter! Keep heading forward!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Several archers rained down hails of arrows at Kailas who was yelling that, but he made use of the net’s recoil as though to mock their effort and they didn’t even graze him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rather he was proactively making them target him so that his comrades wouldn’t be hit.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Shit! This cockroach……!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t get provoked! Aim at the other guys!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Obar noticed Kailas’s plan, the pirates at the vanguard already finished arriving at La Mancha.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Now this is getting fun……eeh?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca glared at the Sanpaniradeon marines that were coming for her like a hawk looking at its prey. She smiled bewitchingly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 9
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……As expected, it seems Kailas is the winner when it comes to individual skill.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Jose was staring at the stranded La Mancha with a cracking voice.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He thought that Kailas was slightly inferior to Urraca in regard to talent as a sailor and let Urraca be the one facing him. However, seeing that Urraca was defeated in ship handling like this, he couldn’t stop thinking, if only he was the one facing Kailas.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, to think that Tormenta Negra would be cornered this quickly…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「We ourselves were taking too long. We can’t laugh at her like this.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The fleet that was led by Kazru was still continuing to get in the way of Jose.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course his opponent was also not getting away unscathed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Half of their ships were already sinking into the sea. Even the remaining ships were only barely floating. There was no hiding the damage they had.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In contrast, Jose’s fleet didn’t have any considerable loss. They were simply getting held back for a long time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kazru was able to hold back the enemy fleet that was at the upwind even now simply because of his iron will that didn’t concern himself about the loss that was inflicted to his fleet.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The opponent is already at the verge of death. They won’t hold if we continue attacking without rest.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Jose judged that Kazru’s fleet had passed their limit and checkmated by the exhaustion from this battle. He ordered his whole fleet to go into an all-out attack.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     With the battle of Urraca and Kailas looking like it would be settled faster than he expected, Jose had to hurry to Urraca’s help.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanjuan fleet stretched its formation horizontally and rapidly approached. Kazru glared at that and climbed on the fore mast to howl to his surviving ships.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It won’t be long before the boss captures the witch! We need just a bit more time! Sorry guys, but entrust your life to me!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll just be troubled even if you tell us to get out of the ship at this point.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yep yep, we’re going to stay here until the last plank of the ship. That’s what comrades are, right?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the first place, the bond between soldiers in the military was strong from entrusting their life to each other, but the solidarity between sailors who would share the same fate together if their ship sank surpassed that of the army.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If they were going to die, they would die together. It was like the fighting spirit of the commander was transferred to the whole Kazru fleet. They launched themselves into the last attack.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Open all the sailsss! Crash on them if you need to!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The charge that was no different than a suicide attack greatly disturbed the formation of Sanjuan fleet.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all they had no reason to go along with Kazru’s suicide attack when it was them who were winning in this battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Kuh……as expected from Kailas. He has won over his subordinates completely to this degree……!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Jose didn’t have the charisma that would make his subordinates kill themselves for him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although he had superior intellect, he bit his lips so hard it was bleeding seeing this natural talent, the wall of hero that he couldn’t possibly overcome no matter what.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     With precise instructions, he surrounded Kazru’s fleet once more. Even so, Jose’s feeling was far removed from the sensation of victory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 10
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The battle on board of La Mancha was completely putting Urraca and her men at the disadvantage.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They weren’t just losing in number. Even though Urraca’s style was to always fight at the front, here they had to fight while protecting Urraca instead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even the veteran marines couldn’t avoid losing their bearing from fighting in this way that they weren’t used to.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The place where Urraca was fighting was going well locally, but La Mancha’s bow and stern were already suppressed by Kailas and his men.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t take your eyes off from that brat! Stop him with your life if you have to!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Amidst that unfavorable battle, it was Obar and Baldr’s great effort that was putting a stop to Sanpaniradeon’s advance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s fighting strength was something that made everyone wide-eyed in surprise. Even so, there was no way he could mow down the opponents this time like wheat just like the previous battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all, the Black Orca, the marines that were the pride of Sanpaniradeon, had actually received formal education at Trystovy Kingdom in the beginning. They were genuine military personnel.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     These marines had refined swordsmanship and magic, as well as group battle tactics drilled into them. The difficulty they provided couldn’t be compared with some big-headed pirates.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore these guys were coming at them with the readiness to throw away their life. Even Baldr couldn’t possibly take them lightly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sorry! Baldr-dono, please support that place there for a while!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    Obar was positioned on the
    <ruby>
     top board
     <rt>
      battle lookout
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    where he was supporting both Baldr and Urraca from there. He yelled at Baldr.
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The top lookout was located at the center of the main mast. That position had a good view of the whole ship and it was a good place to grasp the situation of the battle. Obar was taking command of the battle while supporting his comrades with splendid archery.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t mind me, just take care of Urraca-dono!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr yelled back even while getting cold sweat from a sword that grazed the tip of his nose.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca’s defeat would mean Majorca Kingdom’s defeat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If they simply intended to win this, then Urraca could just barricade herself inside the captain’s room while waiting for reinforcements to arrive.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Urraca wouldn’t join this sea battle in the first place if she was someone who could hold back like that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca was fighting to surpass Kailas. So her subordinates could only aid her battle to the best of their ability.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uoh!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr reflexively ducked from the sound of an arrow that was slicing through the air.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The enemies were using small bows that could fire repeatedly with a small movement. The archers had been limiting Baldr’s movement since some time ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The small bow had small power and range, but it was extremely troublesome when used at close range combat like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Anyway, you’re a nuisance!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr strengthened his body, mainly in speed. Then he vigorously leaped toward the archers that were protected by their comrades at the front.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two rivals who finally met each other grinned fearlessly at each other with their swords raised.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She had been waiting for this moment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Looking at the only opponent that had ever thrown mud on her face in the past, Urraca’s eyes were like she was seeing the finest quality of dinner and she licked her lips.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She got swindled at the ship handling battle, but the fight was not over yet.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Today she would win and free herself from the shackles of the past. She swore it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She had been destined to shoulder the Majorca navy on her shoulders since she was born. The pride from that duty was exactly what allowed Urraca to take her first step forward.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Here I come, Kailas!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Come! You shrew!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a development that made it unclear just which side was being cornered right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     While Urraca was aware that Sanpaniradeon’s target was her alone, Urraca charged at Kailas on her own accord.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas calmly knocked down Urraca’s full powered swing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then without a moment’s delay, he swung his sword horizontally with the flat of the blade aiming at Urraca. She dodged it calmly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (She isn’t an opponent I can face without seriously trying to kill her──even so, there’s no way I can kill her.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The impression he got after crossing swords was that they were about even with each other. In that case, it went without saying that Kailas was at a disadvantage because he had to capture her alive.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Do you really have any free time to think slowly like that?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca made fun of Kailas’s calculation and attacked consecutively without giving him any breathing room.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her speed was like a flash, but Kailas was unperturbed and completely defended against all of the attacks while counterattacking deftly. However, those attacks also didn’t work.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (This woman dodged with just her damn instincts……guess the other side is more talented than me.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca whose animalistic instinct was working in full capacity, and Kailas whose battle experience had been polished for many years.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two were even against each other. The battle couldn’t be decided so simply.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Nice moves! A shame, you gonna be a fine man if only there are twenty more years!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s an honor to be told that! Unfortunately, I’m at my prime as a man at this moment!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas who had to finish the battle as soon as possible, and Urraca who wanted to win with only her strength. The two of them aimed for a short decisive battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They were attacking toward each other’s vitals without the slightest hesitation. Each of their strikes would kill the other with one attack.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was as though even Kailas had forgotten his objective to capture Urraca alive.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (What a beautiful woman──!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Urraca dressed up, she would be a noble princess who could appear anywhere without shame.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, her beauty that was overflowing with vitality when fighting, as though the god of war was taking possession of her was too much for a brusque man like Kailas.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the only thing he was sure about was that her beauty was beyond any description and it was something that he had never seen before.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was enchanted by that gallant figure of Urraca, but even so the battle instinct that was permeating his body wasn’t weakening at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rather, because all tensions had left his shoulders, his mind that was focused solely on Urraca switched to the commander focus that was overlooking the whole battlefield.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     On the other hand, Urraca who was completely absorbed with fighting could only see Kailas’s figure.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the end, who would obtain the advantage from this difference?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A single arrow that would decide the fate of this battle was going to be fired above the two’s head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was Obar.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He couldn’t give backup at all until now because the two were moving too fast, but Kailas’s movement stopped as though his focus was directed to his surroundings. He believed that this was the best chance to aim at him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Obar-san! Don’t!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr felt a chill that made his back shivered and he yelled.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Based on common sense, there was no doubt that Kailas would be the one at a disadvantage from being targeted by an archer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, in the battle between two first class warriors, often the one who was taken by surprise from the unexpected event would be the one who lost.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca’s focus had reached the extreme. Baldr feared that a half-hearted backup would only get in her way.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sure enough, Kailas had easily noticed Obar’s arrow.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t think that arrow will work on this Clairvoyant Kailas!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas grasped the arrow’s direction and speed just from its sound slicing through air. He didn’t even turn his gaze toward it and accurately hit it toward Urraca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca swiftly deflected the arrow that was approaching right before her eyes, but Kailas’s sword was approaching in that moment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Tsk!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I got you!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca blocked Kailas’s sword right from the front. She didn’t have the leeway to parry that attack away and her body was blown backward.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca had compensated for the difference in weight and physical strength with her technique and speed, but as expected Kailas’s strength was overwhelmingly superior if she lost her composure to make use of them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Kahah!!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca’s back hit a pillar and air was driven out from her lungs.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her body went dizzy from difficulty breathing. Even so, she still desperately tried to stand up, and yet Kailas’s hard leather boot flew toward her stomach.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aguuh!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca was blown away like a ping-pong ball. Kailas looked down at her with his sword pointed down.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s my win!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca’s brain was paralyzed by the intense pain. She couldn’t even reply back.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Just when Kailas was going to pin down Urraca, a hunch that something outrageous was going to kill him with certainty made him reflexively step back.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas looked dumbfounded at the space where he was standing just now. A lump of bloodlust just passed by through there.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Ye shouldn’t harm a woman.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The young boy who should be still fighting at the stern until just now was standing there.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was a young boy with adorable looks who was still in the middle of his teenage years.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the aura of the strong that was emitted from his whole body was the complete opposite of his boyish looks.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You bastard……who the hell are you?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Just an unruly old geezer who loves battle.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The young boy was grinning in a complete delight. Kailas instinctually sensed that he was an even stronger enemy than Urraca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the same time he also felt that most likely, this boy was a veteran soldier who had traversed many more battlefields than him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was impossible. It didn’t matter how much he overestimated the boy’s age, he couldn’t be more than fifteen.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And yet, this violent and raw fighting spirit could only come from someone who had stayed on frontlines for dozens of years.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then there was the boy’s aged gaze, like a predator that had seen through all of the actions he could make…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
<img src="img/204.jpg"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──He couldn’t move.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It felt like he would only dance on the palm of the boy no matter what move he made.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「U…………」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca who was writhing from getting her stomach kicked was assaulted by an intense pain, even so she finally recovered her consciousness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She wondered how much time had passed. When she considered that Kailas still hadn’t finished her off, perhaps not that much time had passed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, why wasn’t she held down by Kailas?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca looked around her in puzzlement. There she found a nostalgic sight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Kyaaah! Ojii-sama! A snake! A snake!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Good grief, how can a woman of the sea fear a mere snake? Where is it, just leave it to your grandpa……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was an important and nostalgic memory that happened more than ten years ago already.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her grandfather raised her strictly, but he couldn’t completely discard his indulgence toward her somewhere inside. The back of her awkward grandfather was overlapping with the back of this boy in front of her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was the back of a man who was stronger than anyone, and who would protect her from everything, the back of someone she could trust unconditionally.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since Urraca lost her grandfather, she thought there wasn’t anybody who would protect her anymore. But now…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「AN OLD MAN CAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was the roar of her jijicon’s soul.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That completely disappointing shriek made both Sanai and Kailas lose all tension and grimace. Nobody there could blame them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『This woman really took out all the motivation from this.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wasn’t like Sanai understood the meaning of Urraca’s words, but he could easily feel Urraca’s fiery gaze looking his way unblinkingly in infatuation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It made the mood completely unsuited for battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Ye just narrowly escaped death, sonny.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He lost his motivation to kill Kailas. However, he didn’t have the slightest intention to stop fighting.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai’s posture obviously shifted into an offensive stance. Cold sweat broke out on Kailas’s back and he also took his stance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That was really boorish just now man, to interrupt just when I was about to push down a woman.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If only he had just thirty more seconds, Kailas would have managed to capture Urraca and proclaimed his victory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai was like a god of pestilence for Kailas.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was someone that he wouldn’t stop hating no matter how much time passed, at the same time he also understood that this was a powerful opponent that he had never encountered before.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If there was any chance of victory……it was the fact that his instinct was telling me that this boy wasn’t a genuine man of the sea.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It had been some time since this ship was stranded. That meant a lot of sea water should have entered the ship’s hold──.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「In that case, that’s gonna happen!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A violent shake.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas kicked on the deck at that moment, as though he had been waiting for La Manch to tilt to the left side.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a prediction and instinct that didn’t put shame to his status as a genius.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For people of the land who always fought above the unshakable land, an unstable place like the ship should be an unimaginably difficult place to fight on.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『There is no warrior who wouldst be scared just because the ground tilt.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For a warrior, being surprised on the battlefield was the same as feeling scared. It was nothing but a disgrace.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If one had become a general at the level of Sanai, the battlefield would also be synonymous with their place to die.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no way they would show such unsightly appearance in their glorious place to die.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For a general who was resolved to die, it didn’t matter even if the earth quaked or the ship lurched, such things were nothing but trivial problems for them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even so, I can’t just withdraw after this far!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if there were times when he fought and lost, he mustn’t lose without even fighting.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if he was called stupid or an idiot because of that, that was the spirit of Sanpaniradeon that lived with freedom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Ye art a worthy enemy. A real man.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas was aware that he was weaker in strength, and yet he didn’t stop fighting. Sanai judged that he was a man who was worthy of praise.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was better to run away if it looked like the battle would be lost. Fight only when it is possible to win.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If it was the previous minister of the right Nobunaga, he would retreat at once without any shame if he judged that his force was weaker.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     People with such thinking were also not rare among Sanai’s colleagues.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The thinking that it was exactly in losing battle where one could obtain glorious achievement was the thinking of a man from an ancient era.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For example, a man like that Maeda Keijirou.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Lose, and then become even stronger next time.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was why he would crush this man with all his strength. But he would at least spare his life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「UOOOOOOOOOOH!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas stepped forward with a yell of fighting spirit. The back of Sanai’s sword was slammed down on the side of his head at that time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uguh!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wouldn’t be strange for an average person to die from that. Even a veteran military officer would have their consciousness robbed away by this attack.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, Kailas only fell on his knee with his consciousness still holding on. Sanai was honestly moved seeing that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『──A man who shouldered his family on his shoulders art really different.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai saw the vestiges of his deceased lords, Gamou Ujisato and Uesugi Kagakatsu in Kailas.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They had the caliber to bear the responsibility of providing for their family, retainers, and people. It was something that Sanai and Keijirou didn’t have.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter how strong he was in battle, a man like Keijirou couldn’t become a lord.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If pushed to say, Sanai was also closer to that kind of type.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And yet what about this man before his eyes? It seemed he had a great caliber in him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Stop fighting! Not a single one of you should die! Sanpaniradeon is surrendering to Majorca Kingdom’s navy right at this moment!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas yelled with blood pouring from his mouth.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「RING THE SURRENDERING BELLLLLLLLLL!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He felt frustrated and also resentful that they failed just one step short from victory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However they were able to fight a battle without any shame to decorate the last moment of Sanpaniradeon.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Surely that fact would also be an advantage when the opponent decided how they would treat Sanpaniradeon after this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Well, as expected he didn’t think that he himself would be able to avoid death.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    Even so, he wanted to try embracing
    <ruby>
     that woman
     <rt>
      Urraca
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    with these hands──.
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He lost the chance to embrace with these hands that war goddess who he unintentionally fell in love with. That was his only regret.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas crumbled and fell on the deck with that thought as the last thing in his mind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 11
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanpaniradeon’s treatment was easily decided.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It would be a waste to disband a sea power of this level. There was no way they could make such a wasteful decision.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And so for the time being Sanpaniradeon would be put under the command of Majorca Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They too wished to become Urraca’s subordinates after seeing the skill and guts that she displayed in the battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And about Kailas, there was also the opinion that he should be executed just like other pirates, but Urraca was firmly opposed to this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t screw with me! I’m not gonna let him get away while he is ahead!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Though she was the victor of this battle in the end, it was personally her defeat both in ship handling and at close range combat. It seemed she couldn’t accept that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Apparently she would challenge him in a ship battle once more as soon as they returned to Majorca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though both sides had just fought each other, the sailors easily reconciled with each other and exchanged drinks together while singing cheerfully.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They lived and died together above the ship. Even when not in battle, the slightest blunder or bad luck could directly lead to death. Perhaps that particular opinion of life and death that was possessed by sailors was what allowed them to throw away the ill feeling between them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And above all else they had recognized each other’s skill as sailors, so they were able to overcome their comrades’ deaths and held hands together.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a development that caused a bit of discomfort in Baldr and Sanai who were land military personnel by nature, but there was no denying that this was the best result for settling the matter.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was fine and all but──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Obar-san, can you tell me what that person is doing?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aah……boss lady must be confused of what should she do in her springtime that arrived too late.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After that battle, La Mancha was somehow given temporary repairs and refloated. They then headed back straight to Majorca Kingdom, but Urraca couldn’t be found in her usual place.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──To be precisely speaking, she was hiding behind a pillar while sending glances at Baldr secretly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was acting distinctly suspicious.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her dynamite proportion was jutting out from the pillar, making her hiding completely useless, but it was unclear whether anyone should point that out or not.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was thinking such a thing when his gaze met with Urraca’s gaze. Then her face reddened as though she was being boiled she vanished from the deck in panic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Just what is she doing……?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You too are really dense, aren’t you……I pity the boss lady.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca went down from the deck to the cabin. Her hand pressed on her chest that wouldn’t stop throbbing at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since that day when she saw her grandfather’s broad and kind back on Baldr, she was unable to look at him straight in the face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uuuuu……just what is this」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was the Tormenta Negra who reigned over the Marmara Sea.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Now that she had made Sanpaniradeon into her subordinate, she was the leader of the biggest naval force in the Marmara Sea that surpassed even Sanjuan Kingdom and Trystovy Dukedom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She could summon a mere brat like Baldr at her own convenience and he would have to respond with respect.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll call him here……and then, what?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca’s body unconsciously bent back and forth when she imagined the situation when she became alone with Baldr inside a cramped cabin.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She didn’t know how she should call him here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though just the other day she could easily go talk to him, put her hand around his shoulders, or grab his hand and make him show her his sword.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When she thought about those times, the heat returned to her face again.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「J-j-j-just, h-holding hand doesn’t mean anything at all!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The hardness of his palm didn’t suit his beautiful looks. It was a hardness that came from training.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     One’s hand wouldn’t become that hard and thick without going through hard training that could make someone feel nausea just from imagining it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It reminded her of her old memory of the creased hand of the grandfather she missed. His hand also felt rough and hard.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Thump*, her heart jumped inside her chest again.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Just why did her grandfather’s image overlap with Baldr? She had been observing from a hiding place all this time because she was trying to find the answer, but she didn’t find the answer at all (the person herself didn’t notice that she was acting suspiciously like that).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But, there was no doubt that Baldr’s back at that day, at that moment, it was the back of a warrior who had matured after going through experiences of many years.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Though there was no way that a younger person like Baldr could have accumulated that many experiences…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Unyaaaaah! This isn’t like me at all! I am the peerless Urraca de Parma! Oii! Baldrrrr!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca swung her head left and right emotionally and clenched her fist in front of her chest. Then she rushed once more toward the deck where Baldr was at.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ah, she finally came out. Do you have any business with me?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, that determination was popped like a bubble. Just by standing in front of Baldr, Urraca became unable to say anything again.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ue……? You……wha…………」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca muttered stammeringly with words of unclear meaning. Then steam came out of Urraca’s head again as though her brain had gone through the tolerable limit.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「D, DON’T THINK YOU HAVE WON WITH THISSSSSSSSSSSSS-!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What the hell?」
    </span>
   </p>
