    Side Story – A Commotion From Love

    Part 1
   </h2>
   <p>
    「
    <ruby>
     Midship
     <rt>
      Return the wheel to the center
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    ! It’s a match of crossing up! Hurry!」
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sorry, but you’re too slow!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two ships looked like they were sailing side by side, but the left ship was ahead just slightly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was to say, Kailas was going to win in this challenge from Urraca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Tsk! I’m a step slower!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I still can’t let myself get beaten by the young miss. Even like this, I still have more experience.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas thought that if it was just a matter of talent, then Urraca was superior, though.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, in a secluded space like the sea, experience was also an important aspect.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If a sailor indulged themselves in their own talent and made light of experience, the sea god would bring down the judgment of death on that hubris in most cases.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Kailas, Urraca was also a boss that was hard to obtain. Currently, there was nobody else besides him in Majorca Kingdom who could teach her the importance of experience.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The sailing race went around four buoys floating in the sea. The race was closed at the goal post with a splendid victory for Kailas.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……I can’t wrap my head around it. Even though our technique should be the same, why is it I’m the only one who keeps losing-」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Young miss will be angry if I teach you the answer, won’t you?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Obviously–!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca threw out her chest with a rough huff from indignation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her large breasts that were like ripened watermelons jiggled. It was a stunning sight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas’s gaze was taken by that sight, even though he didn’t intend to. He was speechless.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To be honest, ever since he was apprehended at Akaba, he had some feelings towards Urraca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Can I ask for anything for the prize?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hm? If it’s something I can provide.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then……can young miss go out with me for the whole day on the next holiday?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──What?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca was bewildered by Kailas’s completely unexpected words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course, it wasn’t just Urraca who was bewildered. The men who had been Urraca’s subordinates for many years including the vice captain Orba were all waiting for Urraca’s reply.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Everyone was aware that since Urraca failed in her confession to Baldr the other day, she hadn’t yet recovered her liveliness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They honestly wished that this could at least become an impetus for Urraca to get back on her feet.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course, Kailas himself was fully intending to take advantage of Urraca’s current state that was in heartbreak.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Well, it might be good enough for a diversion……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At that moment, Urraca’s first date with a man was decided.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Urraca, her memory of the night she spent with Baldr was a bitter memory even now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Just what was lacking from me……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The answer to that question was everything. But Urraca wasn’t mature enough right now to be able to realize that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Or rather, she was on the level of ‘is it alright for you to be in such a maidenly mentality at your age?’, so she was only getting toyed around by Maria easily.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, her chest would feel constricted with a sweet throbbing when Baldr entered her mind. Perhaps it could be said that she was growing up splendidly just from that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Women are all about sex appeal! There is no man that won’t waver in front of sex appeal!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was Maria’s claim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was why Urraca did her best despite her shyness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Despite her lack of interest towards men, even Urraca could at least feel shy just like a normal person.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However it seemed Baldr was a bit different of a man even for even a veteran like Maria.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I can’t believe how wrong I was……I thought because he has a fiancée that he has done at least some things……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed a man who wasn’t used to humans would cringe instead at a push that was done excessively.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In that case, her effort that she was doing shyly at that time was simply pointless. Urraca had shamed herself for nothing, no, not even for nothing, it was for the worse instead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Against this kind of man, the best plan is……shyness!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was a part of her that questioned herself whether it was alright to keep listening to Maria’s advice like this, but it was also a fact that Urraca had nobody else she could consult with other than Maria.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The invitation from Kailas came just at the right timing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Guess I’ll give it a try.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Just as her personality suggested, Urraca was someone who was decisive when making decisions.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 2
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The fountain of Parma──it was a place that was often used by lovers for a rendezvous……but the attention to couples today wasn’t ordinary.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca was wearing a light blue blouse and a skirt with a checkered pattern, but because she was making a despondent face looking like she was waiting for someone, men who came talking to her immediately appeared one after another.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Those men also surely never even imagined that the beauty before their eyes was that famous Tormenta Negra herself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m sorry, I’m waiting for someone else so……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Normally this was where she would punch those men flying without any hesitation, but Urraca endured it while her fortitude was being heavily tested.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You should just abandon a man who would let a beauty like you waiting!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I-I know a good restaurant that isn’t really well-known around here!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──These guys, are they your acquaintances, young miss?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas arrived at the rendezvous place with a perplexed face. He was puzzled seeing the crowd that was formed around Urraca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The usual Urraca would undoubtedly snap and rampage already in this situation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But in contrast to that thought of Kailas, Urraca’s reaction greatly betrayed his expectation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her expression brightened sweetly, then right after that she looked down shyly and clutched at Kailas’s sleeve slowly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Anyone who saw this scene would think they were looking at a pair of innocent lovers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──Only if those people didn’t know the actual Urraca though.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas’s brawny body that was tanned under the sea sun and Urraca’s chaste beauty looked very unbalanced when paired together. The men who were surrounding Urraca were immediately enraged.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From their perspective, it only looked like Kailas was threatening Urraca to go out with him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oi-! Old man, say your prayer to your maker!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However Kailas was a man who was the big boss of a pirate group not a long time ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His boiling point was actually lower than even Urraca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Who are you calling old man, huh! I’m still 42!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No, that’s what you call an old man──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I ain’t an old man! I said I’m not!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter the era, the mental state of a man in his forties would always be complicated.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no way the city hoodlums could do anything against a veteran marine like Kailas.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It didn’t even take a minute before the street was filled with bodies lying spread-eagled everywhere.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Kailas-san, you’re really strong.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca smiled in admiration at Kailas. It made Kailas yell with his eyes widened like saucers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Are you really okay? Did you perhaps drink something bad……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was here that Urraca’s hell crashed on the forehead of Kailas who was plainly suspecting Urraca’s odd behavior.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Actually, this man called Kailas was an eccentric who had never gone out with a woman even once until now. In other words, these two were quite similar to one other.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though such a thing happened, the two of them conveniently treated it like it never happened. Urraca started walking while cuddling close to Kailas’s side.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「And, where are you going to take me to?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「A, aa……I heard that recently there is a café opened by someone who studied at Mauricia……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas was seriously considering taking Urraca to a doctor to check her head, but he rethought it thinking that it was the pain of heartbreak that was making Urraca like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In that case, healing Urraca’s heartbreak was the mission that was imposed on him. Yes, there was no doubt about it!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s here! Apparently you can eat something novel here.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas said that while pointing at the branch store of Olive Brown Café that was selling castella at Mauricia Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The manager of this branch café was born in Majorca. It seemed he decided to take the plunge and open this café in order to quickly popularize this new cuisine.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hou……! So this is what they called castella!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The castella was brought to them after waiting thirty minutes. Even Kailas, who didn’t particularly like sweet things, could be seen with sparkling eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then when he reached with his fork to immediately taste it…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Kyah!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The hand of Urraca who was also reaching toward the castella at the same time bumped with Kailas’s hand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her face blushed bright red, then Urraca sent an upward gaze at Kailas with her hand still touching his hand. She kept sending him brief glances.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I-I’m sorry, I……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「N-no……don’t mind it! Let’s eat this right away!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas was wailing inside his heart seeing Urraca’s feverish gaze.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (This…….she became this frail……! That Mauricia brat, he better prepare himself to pay for this the next time we meet!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas brought the castella into his mouth while sniffling. Urraca stared at him in dissatisfaction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After that, they went shopping and did things like gambling for diversion. Then for the finale, the two of them headed to a viewing platform.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a great date spot where lovers could watch the sunset together, but today the viewing platform was completely empty except for the two of them, even though usually it would be packed with couples.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It went without saying that behind this there was the secret maneuvering of sailors with scary faces.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Kyah!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca who was starting to climb the stair of the viewing platform suddenly staggered. She ended up hugging Kailas’s back from behind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas was taken aback as though he had gotten electrified when he felt Urraca’s large breasts on his back.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, it wasn’t gentlemanly to turn into a beast when facing a weak woman.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kailas too was getting carried away for misunderstanding that he was a gentleman at this point of time, but if only he still had the leeway to calmly observe Urraca, he would surely notice the throbbing vein on her forehead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If only his sense for danger was working normally, he would also notice how the voltage of the danger was also rising.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then the climax.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In front of the sunset, after shyly hesitating many times, Urraca softly leaned on Kailas’s shoulder.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The warm body heat and the fragrance of flowers tickled Kailas’s nose.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And yet, Kailas didn’t even twitch.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Wh-wh-what, what should I do!? Why is this guy not shaken at all? Would it be better if I hug him?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca was desperately thinking, but Kailas was simply unable to move because he was at his wits’ end.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Snap!*
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Inside Urraca, something was crumbling with a snapping sound.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「WH-WHO CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE THAAAAAAAAAAAAAATT!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca screamed while shaking her head wildly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Am I that lacking in charm? Is acting feminine really that unsuited for meeeee!」
    </span>
