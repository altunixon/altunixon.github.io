    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 1
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanjuan Kingdom is a country located to the south of Mauricia Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It’s known as a maritime nation that stretched for a good distance to the east and west. The southern half of the country has hot subtropical weather.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The country thrives on its fishing and shipping industries. On the other hand, its agricultural production was limited. The majority of its grain came from exports from the Mauricia Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Its relationship with Mauricia Kingdom was fundamentally good. Conversely,  its relationship with its fellow maritime neighboring country, Trystovy, could only be considered bad.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore, political refugees in great numbers have been flooding into their country as of late due to the continuing civil war in the Trystovy Dukedom. It was starting to become a large social problem.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In such a situation, Baldr Cornelius was appointed to be an ambassador to the Sanjuan Kingdom. It was rare for someone his age to receive such an appointment even if one looked at the history of Mauricia Kingdom. His objective was, of course, to sell favor to the Sanjuan Kingdom and strengthen the relationship between the two countries.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I should have dressed lighter than this……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr muttered while fanning his sweaty chest with his palm.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The heat and humidity felt like they had doubled since they passed the Piller Massif, which acts as the boundary between Mauricia and Sanjuan.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In both of his previous lives (Japan) and his present life (Mauricia Kingdom), Baldr was living in a country with a temperate zone── a country with four seasons. This heat that felt like it was coiling around his body was really uncomfortable for him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr wiped the sweat on his forehead with a white handkerchief that was Selina’s present for him. He recalled when his lovers sent him off from the royal capital tearfully three days ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He felt like Selina’s scent was drifting from the handkerchief.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun had been living together with him like family, while he had been interacting with Selina like a bosom buddy. But with the change of their relationship, their feelings also changed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since their relationship openly became lovers, the three of them had to tolerate various changes. There were really a lot of such things.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「E-err……can I perhaps ask young master to call me, Seyruun?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「O-of course, Sey-nee……Seyruun.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun fidgeted shyly while asking him pleadingly with an upward gaze. It was like she was being teased.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s cheeks also reddened seeing that. It was a warming sight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「T-then, p-perhaps I also……should call young master as h-husband……?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Whoats(What)?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wondered what kind of shaming play this was. Even so, he also certainly felt an indescribable sensuality and sweet pleasure from being called husband.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……If Seyruun is alright with that……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「H-husband!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Seyruun……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Husband……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Enough already ya two-!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A sharp retort interrupted from the side of Baldr and Seyruun, who were staring at each other with glistening eyes while producing a bakaple(idiot couple) aura endlessly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr and Seyruun right now were the very picture of a stupid looking couple who flirted with each other without any regards to their surroundings. There was no way to defend their behavior, even with flattery.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina had to show them how to interact with each other as lovers with moderation here as the oldest one.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Yes, even if they were now lovers, she had to resolutely take the initiative and lead Baldr correctly──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If Seyruun call ya husband, what should I call ya then……?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina said that while pressing her chest on Baldr’s shoulder to lean on him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The sensation of the heavily laden fruits being pressed on his shoulder, causing their shape to change elastically, made Baldr’s face turn boiling red. Seyruun frowned with displeasure.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「…………Come to think of it, I have a request to make to Selina.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「A request from Baldr……ask me for anythin’.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「We have finally became lovers, so can I fluff not just your ears but also your tail?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Funyah!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her enthusiasm to take the lead had scattered to the wind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina turned bright red until her neck and became scared stiff instantly. Her bushy tail turned toward Baldr along with her bottom. She pointed them toward him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「D-don’t be too rough ‘kay……?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Leave everything to me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s eyes blazed brightly at Selina’s tail that appeared even in his dream. His fingers caressed it like when he was scooping hair.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina’s tail had a dark brown color with white mixed in. It had a glossiness that was different from her ears. The tail was filled with alluring texture that made him want to keep touching it forever.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Amazing……it’s fluffy……it’s irresistible.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s fingers kept caressing the tail thoroughly, through every nook and cranny. It seemed he touched Selina’s sensitive part because she started making an agonized voice. The sweetness in her voice stimulated Baldr’s sadism.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Nnh!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hyauh!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ukuuu!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The erotic voice that was trying to hold it in even though it was impossible was leaking out from Selina’s lips intermittently.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The person herself was blocking her mouth so that her voice wouldn’t slip out, but it was completely useless.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s breathing was getting rougher because of how seductive Selina was looking. He was going to go further and toy with the base of her tail, but…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Enough already-! This enemy of women!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Baldr-sama! You have to be punished!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was made to sit with seiza posture by the two, whose faces had turned into hannya. His time of bliss was over and he was forced to endure a very long scolding.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I want to fluff that tail once more……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Baldr, you’re making a lewd look right now.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「At least let me immerse myself in my memory!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr snorted in displeasure at his friend Brooks beside him, who was making a merciless quip toward him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was only natural, but Baldr wasn’t the only one heading to Sanjuan Kingdom as the envoys of Mauricia Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Other than his friends Brooks and Teresa, two official knights from Crimson Flame Knight Order were accompanying him, as well as a royal court secretary named Oliver who would act as his adviser.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From what Oliver told him, it seemed that he would be forced to make a difficult political decision that surpassed his expectations in Sanjuan Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Nobody except that schemer King Welkin would even consider appointing a young boy like Baldr to be a goodwill ambassador, even by mistake.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Normally, experience meant everything when dealing with a diplomatic problem like this time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter how they saw it, the biggest political problem in the Sanjuan Kingdom right now was how the first prince Abrego died from a disease even though he was the heir to the throne.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If things went smoothly, the second prince Franco should be the next king, but Franco was born from the second queen while the third prince Pedro was born from the first queen, so it seemed the political strife between the two concerning who would become the new crown prince was intensifying.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In this situation, it was possible enough that the one who obtained the technique to deal with the disease Baldr provided would be one step closer to the throne.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Good grief……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Most likely that king had known about this from the start.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr thought with a sigh.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was good and all to make Sanjuan Kingdom indebted to him. But, if he sold the favor to the wrong party, his effort would all come to naught.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Who should he sell this favor to──this was a problem that would also seriously affect Baldr’s own safety.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The terrifying thing here was that Baldr shouldn’t simply focus on selling favors to the Sanjuan Kingdom. Welkin was also implicitly enticing him to go a step further than that and find someone who could be his backer from here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he had a strong connection with Sanjuan Kingdom on top of his achievement and position, the nobles who were envious of him and the bureaucrats who were hostile towards him within the Mauricia Kingdom would hesitate in directly trying anything with him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     International relationships is like an Achilles’ heel for bureaucrats who could only display their power within the country.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although this matter was nothing more than Welkin’s needless worry. He didn’t know about the terrifying influence of Baldr’s mother, Maggot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I wish I could enjoy the student life for a bit more……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He also wanted to earn money without any needless obligation weighing him down.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I have gathered enough money to fill a bathtub, just like I dreamed, though……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The town of Malaga(マラガ)──a stopping point before departing to the capital Cadiz(カディス) was finally coming into view. A line of dust cloud was rising from the town.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Several men who seemed to be knights were approaching this way on horses.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They had tanned skin and wore helmets that were richly colored. It was undoubtedly the equipment of the Sanjuan Kingdom’s formal knights.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Now then, only god knows what will happen from here……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr drove away his nostalgia towards the wonderful days that were now gone to the corner of his mind. He exchanged glances with Brooks and called for everyone in the diplomatic party to stop.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He prayed that at the very least the other side would have someone friendly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 2
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Welcome to our Sanjuan Kingdom. I welcome your arrival from the bottom of my heart.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The one who welcomed the party at Malaga was the viceroy of this town, Rodriguez de Vega(ロドリゲス・デ・ベガ).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had a youthful look, but there were some white streaks in his hair. He was a great man in his fifties and it seemed he also had experience as a military man in the past. His well trained body was still covered with a magnificent armor of muscles.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Speaking of Malaga, it was a huge city that was second to the royal capital Cadiz. The area here was one of Sanjuan Kingdom’s few grain-producing regions. For generations, the one who served as the viceroy of this city would be an authority who shouldered a weighty position within the country.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Rodriguez didn’t act boastful at all despite his high position. Baldr held a favorable impression towards him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m very grateful for this generous welcome. I am the ambassador that Mauricia Kingdom dispatched, Baron Baldr Severn Cornelius. Please treat me as you see fit.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rodriguez’s expression twisted from being taken aback by Baldr’s speech. He must be thinking that it would be Oliver who was the ambassador, based on his age.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Certainly, it was impossible for a fourteen year old to be an ambassador in a normal case.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Did you say Cornelius just now?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Baldr’s prediction about the reason for Rodriguez’s reaction was wrong.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What made him be taken aback wasn’t because Baldr was the ambassador, but because he was from Cornelius House. it seemed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yes, I am the eldest son of Count Cornelius.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rodriguez ooh-ed hearing that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He looked somewhat nostalgic and pitying……Rodriguze looked once more at Baldr with such a complicated expression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The splendid silver hair, the eye glint with strong will within, well-ordered bridge of nose, and the shape of his mouth, all-together possessing both dignity and glamour. All of those features were enough to make Rodriguez recall a certain woman that he knew in the past.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Is Maggot-dono doing well?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Do you know my mother?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s eyes reflexively widened at the very unexpected question.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr couldn’t think up anything at all that could be a point of contact between the great man before him and that mother who was the very picture of audacity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Actually, I’m indebted to Maggot-dono for saving my life in the pirate subjugation at Marmara Sea. I asked her at that time to join the military of this country no matter what but……I never even imagined that she would end up the wife of a count.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Just what were you doing, Okaa-sama, to even come until this far……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was made to realize anew just how absurd his mother was.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was that mother they were talking about. There was no doubt in his mind that she gleefully joined the fighting here with the simple reason that fighting at sea seemed fun.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Originally in naval battles, mercenaries, even the veterans, are not really useful because they have to fight on top of a shaky ship. At that time, the pirates had the geographical advantage and predicted the sea current. My fleet got separated and was put under concentrated attack. I was ready to die at that time. Only until Maggot-dono brought the glory of victory along with her name of “Silver Light”, that is.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rodriguez narrowed his eyes with nostalgia.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr wondered whether it was longing, reverence, or affection that was within this man’s eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I will never forget it for my whole life……the gallant figure of that maiden who gleamed silver on that ocean……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he put together Rodriguez’s story, it seemed that the flagship that Rodriguez boarded received a concentrated attack and the pirates managed to board the ship, bringing the battle into a close melee.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Half of the crew died, while the enemy’s numbers were still numerous. It was then that Maggot jumped from another allied ship and annihilated the pirates all by her lonesome.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was as though Maggot was flying above the ship that was fiercely shaking on the sea. No, in fact she was mostly fighting while in the air.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was so fast that to Rodriguez, it looked like Maggot was gliding on the deck instead of running.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr, the heartless son that he was, was seriously questioned whether or not his mother was really human.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If you’re Maggot-dono’s son, that means you are the son of my life’s savior. If there is anything that I can be of help with, then just ask me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「For us to meet like this must be some kind of destiny at work too. If you don’t mind then there is a serious matter that I wish to ask……how is the situation right now with the successor of Prince Abrego?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rodriguez grinned joyfully.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed he got interested in just how knowledgeable the boy before him was.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Do you know my position?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I believe that you are related to the second queen as her cousin. I’m aware that you should support the second prince due to your family ties. However, such a matter is unrelated to whether the second prince is at an advantage or not.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Have you considered that I might lie to you?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──If it’s a lie that can be seen through easily, then I can only say that Lord Rodriguez will regret it later on. Besides, as a citizen of the Sanjuan Kingdom, you must not wish to allow intervention from another country carelessly.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What was important for Baldr──which was to say Mauricia Kingdom was to build a friendly relationship with the next heir to the throne. They didn’t have any desire to take part in deciding who would be the next heir of the throne.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Also, Sanjuan Kingdom naturally didn’t wish to be indebted to the Mauricia Kingdom too much.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then I too shall speak without holding anything back in deference to Baldr-dono……the second prince, his highness Franco is superior to the third prince, his highness Pedro in insight and ability, without any doubt. However, he unfortunately doesn’t desire the throne.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「His highness Franco, doesn’t wish for the throne?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「At the very least he doesn’t wish for it as much as the queen dowager Elena-dono. Though I can’t claim to know the reason why.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wasn’t hard to imagine that the reason Rodriguez knew this information was because of his blood relationship with the second prince.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If this information was commonly known, then the race for the throne should have been decided a long time ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr felt thankful to Rodriguez who easily provided him with this information. At the same time he felt a chill.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Franco lost in this race, there was a possibility that Rodriguez would also get demoted due to his status as Franco’s relative. And yet he still told Baldr about this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Or perhaps his true intention was to distance Franco from the throne?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed from now on Baldr would be constantly pressed to do advanced information gathering and make high level political decisions. It made Baldr feel something close to resignation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (As I thought, there is no way I’ll be able to finish my duty as ambassador peacefully without any problem……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr didn’t ask whether he should support Franco or Pedro.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A foreigner shouldn’t decide anything like that. In the first place, he should avoid any careless intervention as much as possible.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rodriguez telling him this much information was nothing more than a declaration of his friendliness toward Baldr regardless of what kind of intention Baldr had. If Baldr asked for even more information than this or made any unnecessary enquiry, his evaluation toward Baldr would fall, and in the worst case, he could even turn into an enemy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m grateful for the precious information. I won’t forget this debt.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No no, compared to my debt to Maggot-dono for saving my life, I’m ashamed that this is the most I can do. Please don’t mind it.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rodriguez was maintaining a calm expression while saying that, but he was astonished on the inside.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr hadn’t completely trusted Rodriguez, but he also kept his respect toward him──his discernment in analyzing the information while still being careful so that he wouldn’t overstep his position was really unthinkable, coming from someone who was still a boy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although his appearance was still that of a fourteen years old boy, he was like a completely different person inside.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Thinking back, Baldr’s mother Maggot was also even more absurd.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (……Now then, I only hope that his ability to invite trouble everywhere he goes won’t be similar with his mother. It’s for his own sake, too……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Baldr could hear what Rodriguez was thinking, he might cry due to the misfortune of the blood that was flowing inside his body.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Without even knowing what Rodriguez was thinking, Baldr gulped the fruit wine to satisfy his dry throat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The fruit wine that was cooled using underground water permeated into his body, which was tired from the heat and humidity, like a rain that came after a drought.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">

    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 3
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yes! God hasn’t abandoned me!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The second queen of Sanjuan Kingdom Elena(エレーナ) couldn’t hold back from shouting with exultation at the tragic sudden death of the crown prince Abrego.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If the eldest son of the first queen Maria(マリア) was still alive, the rule of the eldest son succeeding the throne would be unshakable, but if he died then it was only natural for her son, the second prince Franco, to succeed the throne.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Among the vassals, there were also some who said that the third prince Pedro who was born from Maria should succeed the throne. However, Maria didn’t have a firm political foundation in Sanjuan Kingdom because she was a princess from a small island country called Majorca(マジョルカ).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The number of vassals who supported Elena’s son Franco was more than the Pedro faction, since she was a daughter of an influential great noble in the Sanjuan Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her skin that was starting to look slightly emaciated because she was entering her thirties reddened in excitement. Elena laughed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You will get what’s coming for you, Maria……how dare a mere little pirate girl like you……make this me lose face!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Originally, it was Elena who first became the fiancée of the king Carlos(カルロス).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena’s father was the viceroy of the large city Cordoba, which was located inland. When she was still a young girl, Elena never doubted that she would be the one standing beside Carlos as the queen.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Sanjuan Kingdom’s pillar of economy was overseas trade. The country was unable to endure the damage from the frequent piracy and chose to form an alliance with Majorca Kingdom, an island country located in the south. Elena’s position took a turn for the worse with that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Carlos took the princess of Majorca Kingdom, Maria, as his wife. Because of that, Elena who had been revered by everyone around her since she was little had to content herself with the position of the second queen.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Majorca was a small country that seemed like it could be easily erased from the map. The princess of that country wasn’t just in a higher position than her, but her son would also succeed the throne of this Sanjuan Kingdom. That fact brought much despair and fury inside Elena’s heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──She couldn’t endure it any longer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    Now that Abrego has died, she would put her son Franco on the king’s throne no matter what she had to do and leave
    <ruby>
     that woman
     <rt>
      Maria
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    speechless.
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, she had a concern. She expected that her father’s cousin Joan, who was also the prime minister, would become her biggest supporter. However, he had died due to that epidemic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It didn’t stop just there, several of her noble acquaintances had also died from the disease. It threw the palace’s map of influence into a bit of chaos.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At that time there was also a risk of her and her irreplaceable son getting infected by the epidemic too.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was really annoying. The bloodline of that woman really brought nothing but trouble.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Just wait, Franco. Your mother swears she will prepare a position that is worthy for you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena brushed up her red hair that looked like a blazing fire and smiled sweetly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 4
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanjuan Kingdom’s capital Cadiz was an enormous port city that was in possession of a naturally good harbor. Due to the civil war in Trystovy Dukedom, the number of ships there had been drastically reduced, so right now the harbor here could boast a reputation of being one of the harbors with the most trade in the continent.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Two layers of huge ramparts were surrounding the outer circumference of the city. Their length was more than thirty kilometers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although it had a different structure, this city was also impregnable, just like Mauricia’s capital Cameron.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr keenly felt just how wide the world was while speaking to the knights who were standing guard at the castle gate.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I am Baron Baldr Severn Cornelius. I came as an ambassador of Mauricia Kingdom. I wish to be granted the honor to have an audience with his majesty.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Please wait here for a short while.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The knight guarding the gate politely bowed his head before turning around along with his colleague.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two knights with large builds disappeared behind the gate with the clanking metallic sound of their armor. Several soldiers were staying behind to continue their guard.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed Rodriguez had contacted the palace beforehand. It didn’t take that long until their escort arrived.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──I shall serve as your guide. I am a knight of the palace’s security troops, Sepata Sarmiento(セパタ・サルミエント). Please come this way.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The previous knights returned along with a giant who was more than two meters tall.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had a toned and proportional build. For Baldr who had faced numerous outstanding warriors, it was clear that he was one of the foremost fighters in the Sanjuan Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They passed a corridor with good ventilation that was suitable for a southern country. There they were met with a garden that was decorated with richly colored flowers. This too was something characteristic to a southern country.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a sight that even Masaharu and Sanai who were sleeping inside him never saw before. Baldr’s eyes widened slightly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Good grief, I’d be able to relax and enjoy a lot of things here if only there wasn’t this ambassador duty……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It looks like this sight pleased you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yes, a splendid garden like this will be hard to find in Mauricia.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sepata noticed the change in his expression and peered into Baldr’s eyes with deep interest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed this man was really attentive unlike what his appearance suggested. From his bearing and manners, he might come from an upper class noble family.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You won’t be able to find the vegetation in this garden anywhere else but Sanjuan, even if you search the whole continent. Although it’s the pride of our country, it’s certainly not something that can be seen so often.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sepata spoke proudly. It left a good impression in Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For him to be able to feel this honestly proud of his homeland meant that he had little dissatisfaction towards the royal family.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please continue walking. His majesty is waiting.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They arrived in front of a door that was even larger than Sepata’s body. There he slowly bent at the waist.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed he wouldn’t accompany Baldr inside.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr faced Sepata and bowed before he pushed open the door with his palm.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The door that looked really heavy was opened in front of Baldr’s eyes without any resistance, as though it had been oiled very well.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Behind the door there were unexpectedly very few people.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The space could easily be filled with several hundred people, and yet less than ten people were inside. The sight looked melancholic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The current king Carlos V was known as a wise ruler who developed Sanjuan Kingdom as a maritime nation, but on the other hand he was weak in battle and in the past he was defeated often in naval battles.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because of that, the position of military officer in the Sanjuan Kingdom was relatively on the rise.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the prime minister Joan who had experience as a military minister as well died from the cholera epidemic. Because of that, the atmosphere in the palace was changing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was only logical that the civil officials were gaining prominence when war was becoming more distant. The military affairs that had no productivity whatsoever being reduced in peace time was also common, as proved in history.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The civil officials were supporting the intelligent and mild-mannered second prince Franco in the successor issue this time. They were maneuvering to rewrite the faction map within Sanjuan Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco had a mother who was the daughter of a duke, and he also obtained overwhelming support from the palace’s civil officials. However, there was still a good reason he couldn’t rest on his laurels.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The military that feared the civil officials gaining strength decided to recommend the third prince Pedro succeeding the throne with the backing of Majorca Kingdom, which was also an allied country and a fellow maritime country.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I am the king of Sanjuan, Carlos. I’m greatly obliged by the consideration of Mauricia’s king.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s an honor to be able to be in the presence of your majesty. My name is Baron Baldr Severn Cornelius. I’m extremely blessed to be bestowed with the chance of having an audience at your majesty’s leisure.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though Carlos was still in his forties which should be near his prime, he looked emaciated like someone entering the latter half of his sixties.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His eyes looked sunken and his skin was darkish and lacked in luster. It was obvious from a glance just how bad his complexion was.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps it couldn’t be helped for him to look like this because he had just lost his eldest son whom he put his hope onto, but this…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I have nothing but gratitude for the method to treat the disease that we received the other day. Thanks to that, the epidemic is finally getting under control and we are able to decrease the number of victims to less than half of our estimation. If only we learned of this treatment method faster……no, it’s pointless even if I mention this.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The chance of Prince Abrego being saved was high if they were able to treat him correctly from the start. However, the symptoms appeared faster in the prince than even Princess Rachel in Mauricia. It was impossible for the treatment method to reach him in time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course Carlos also knew that much.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I know that what I’m going to ask is shameless, but I wish that you can keep it a secret that the treatment method came from Mauricia. At the very least for the time being.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──We had no intention of publicizing it from the beginning.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Carlos let out a tired sigh when he heard Baldr’s reply.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His large body and broad shoulders looked dispirited. It made him look smaller than he was.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Forgive me……right now we can’t have anything that might shake the royal authority.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In other words, the fact that Abrego played a part in the spreading of the cholera infection was having a huge effect.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because of that, dissatisfaction among the commoners and nobles who became victims was increasing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although in the first place the cholera this time originated from a brothel, so Abrego himself was also one of the victims, but it was an irrefutable fact that Abrego was the one who brought the germ into the palace.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed that the king wanted to make it look like it was the royal family that discovered the method to treat cholera in order to calm down that ill feeling and maintain reverence towards the royal family.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In addition, the hand pump that Baldr invented and was being spread among the people would surely be used by the royal family to win back their popularity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For the Mauricia Kingdom, it would be more beneficial if the Sanjuan Kingdom was politically stable. This request from King Carlos was within expectations, so there wasn’t any reason for Baldr to refuse.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「My king has commanded me to answer all of your majesty Carlos’s demands no matter the cost. There is no need to feel reserved.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Umu, I shall never forget this debt.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Carlos’s words were worth more than gold.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It could be said that more than half of Baldr’s objective had been achieved just from being able to obtain those words. A king’s pledge toward another country had that much weight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no way someone as intelligent as Carlos couldn’t see through Mauricia’s expectations for both their countries to fight Trystovy together one day.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     With this there effectively was a secret agreement formed between Mauricia Kingdom and Sanjuan Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Let me introduce my sons to you, Baron Baldr……come forward, Franco.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     With Carlos’s words, the young man standing at his right raised his head that was looking down.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was immediately turning speechless when he saw the young man’s face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr himself also had a face that could be mistaken as a girl. However, his build was almost completely like that of an adult’s. No one had ever mistook his gender within these past several years.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     On the other hand, Franco’s translucent looks could only be described as a beautiful girl’s, no matter how anyone saw him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Red hair that was sparkling like it was blazing, and glistening almond shaped eyes. A small and well ordered bridge of the nose and bright red lips like ripe fruit. His features reminded Baldr of the actress Takarazuka Revue in Masaharu’s memory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rather than a man with feminine appearance, this person’s appearance made Baldr feel like it would be more accurate to describe him as a beauty dressed in man’s clothing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「My name is Franco Cordoba de Sanjuan(フランコ・コルドバ・デ・サンファン). Pleased to make your acquaintance.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s my pleasure. I’m extremely grateful to be able to obtain your highness’s favor.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     France elegantly lowered his head with a sway of his willowy slim waist. Baldr hurriedly bowed back.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because of that, Baldr missed how his extremely problematic childhood friend was reflexively letting her muttering slip out.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oo……how beautiful! For such person to be a male, this must be a guidance from god!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Baldr’s ears caught that mutter, he might punch his fellow traveler with all his strength.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
<img width="50%" src="img/029.jpg"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa who should harbor strong sexual interest toward the same sex was staring at Franco’s face intently with the face of a maiden in love.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa was aware of her sexual disposition when she was eight years old.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Before, after she got acquainted with Baldr, her father Mattis who was planning to have his daughter married to Baldr asked her「What do you think about Baldr after playing with him?」 She answered vaguely with「He is a really interesting guy」.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After that, in contrast to her father’s expectation, although she got closer with Baldr, there was no romantic emotion blooming between them. Instead her interest was directed towards the beautiful girl Seyruun at Baldr’s side.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She liked small and adorable things. She thought it was because she was a girl, but before long she noticed that the likes of other women were different from her likes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was a girl called Rina who was a childhood friend of Teresa.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was a lively pretty girl who would always move around tirelessly. She often took Teresa out to the river or lake to play house.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Years passed and one day Rina fell in love.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The person she liked was a merchant’s son who was a friend of her big brother. He was a smart boy two years older than her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rina who was awakened to love looked like she was spilling out radiance like a beautifully blooming flower. It rustled Teresa’s chest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She felt an intense jealousy that she was feeling for the first time since she was born. At that time Teresa finally realized that the jealousy didn’t come from a reason like her best friend being taken away.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She loved Rina.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She wanted to embrace her petite body.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She wanted to lickity lick her healthily tanned skin.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To be more specific, she wanted to do this and that to the girl’s secret and important part…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For some reason a suspicious Teresa who sported an ecstatic smile and blushing cheeks could be found there.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In other words, she could feel lust only towards a beautiful girl of the same sex. Teresa wondered what kind of prank the god played on her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was the moment of sudden emergence of sexual harassment devil Teresa who later on would drive Seyruun and numerous other beautiful girls into the bottom of terror.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course it went without saying that her confession to her first love was broken to pieces in vain with a single word of 「Pervert!」.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That pervert Teresa of all people couldn’t take off her gaze from the fully-fledged male Franco, even for an instant.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa had welcomed her fifteenth birthday slightly earlier than Baldr just the other day. For her, this was the first time her heart was stolen this badly by a man.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She didn’t even feel this much impact when she met Baldr, one of her very few male friends.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her chest felt painful as though her heart was in an eagle grip.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa who was the very picture of arrogance was holding her breath while simply staring without being unable to do anything else. Baldr would surely open his eyes wide like saucers if he noticed this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aa……how beautiful……I can’t believe there is an existence this beautiful in this world.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Yes, Franco looked more beautiful and bewitching than anybody else she knew.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If there was a problem, it was that his beauty wasn’t the beauty of a man by any means, but the beauty of a woman.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Welcome to Sanjuan Kingdom. I can’t give enough thanks to Lord Baldr for bringing the treatment method for that terrifying disease into our country.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco lowered his head and spoke his gratitude with a high pitched and delicate soprano that also didn’t sound like it was a voice that belonged to a man at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As a matter of fact, the cholera that Abrego brought caused a grave danger to the royal family.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although Franco didn’t catch the disease, if the sick people weren’t isolated and their wastes disposed of just like the instruction from Mauricia told them to, nobody knew what would happen.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was even possible that the royal family including the king would be annihilated.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No one could object even if Baldr were to be called the savior of this country with how he protected the honor and continuance of the royal family.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Most likely, the reason Welkin sent Baldr here as an ambassador despite his young age was also because of that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr could clearly imagine in his mind Welkin’s figure chuckling with a villainous expression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「We can’t recognize your accomplishment publicly because of our circumstances, but if there is anything that I can possibly be of help with then I shall do so with all my power. Both of us are also close in age to each other, so I’ll be grateful if we could be friends.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco had just celebrated his seventeenth birthday, but when he looked at Baldr, he couldn’t believe that Baldr was still fourteen and a half years old. He even questioned that perhaps he was the younger one here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Both of them shouldered a heavy burden that didn’t suit their age and possessed inherent talent from their birth. Perhaps it was only natural for France to feel an affinity to Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But putting that aside──Franco thought.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wondered who the red haired young man was, whose gaze had been fixed on him since some time ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That passionate gaze that seemed like it was delirious with fever was something he had seen before.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Knights who didn’t know about Franco’s status would occasionally think of him as a woman and gaze at him like this. But, it was rare for a man to stare at him so blatantly like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When he looked closer, the young man was very good looking. Many women would surely be agitated by his looks.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His faint red hair and large eyes that were filled with strong curiosity were eye-catching. His slender and balanced build, his lustrous and porcelain-like skin, all of those seemed to be wasted on a man.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Franco could be frank, this young man fit his preferences. If only this young man was a woman.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco should be used to being showered with attention, but for some reason this blatant stare made his heart throb. It became a bit hard for him to maintain his smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Franco has very few people who he can call friends due to his status. So Baldr-dono, you don’t need to feel any reservation in your interaction with him.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Then please allow this lowly one to accept your majesty’s kind offer……I will be honored if your highness can call me Baldr.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was here Teresa who had been keeping her quiet until now followed her impulse and yelled.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「My name is Teresa Bradford. Please allow me to be counted as one of your highness’s friend too!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Eh……? You’re……a woman?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco who had been under the impression that Teresa was a man until now let out a shocked voice.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His eyes reflexively turned toward Teresa’s hopelessly flat chest, but Teresa’s bearing with the knight uniform she was dressed in was one that really should be called a beauty in male clothing, so Franco wasn’t the only one who was surprised to realize that Teresa was a woman.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even the king Carlos was also standing up in surprise to stare at Teresa.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──You said your name is Bradford, are you Viscount Mattis’s daughter by any chance?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yes. My father is a mere feudal lord of a remote region. I’m amazed that your majesty is aware of him.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I met Lord Mattis once when he was still a member of the Azure Flame Knight Order. At that time Lord Mattis was already a vice captain, but it was said that he was the strongest one in the knight order.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That father who was a whipped husband by her mother at home was greatly renowned in a foreign country as well.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Every time he opened his mouth he would annoyingly pester her with words like 「Be more feminine」 or 「Go marry」, but it seemed her father was more competent than she thought. Teresa changed her opinion of her father slightly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, it didn’t mean that she had the slightest intention to listen to Mattis’s words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Carlos seemed to see a vestige of Mattis in Teresa’s appearance. His tired face changed into a delighted smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed a nostalgic memory of the past was awakened inside him and he managed to clear up his gloomy feelings somewhat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Now, Pedro too, introduce yourself.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yes, Chichi-ue.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The other young boy walked forward in high spirits after Carlos’s urging.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The young boy had a lively dominating aura and darkish skin that was the characteristic of a southern country. It seemed the blood that he inherited from his mother who came from the Majorca Kingdom could be clearly seen in him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m Pedro Majorca de Sanjuan(ペードロ・マジョルカ・デ・サンファン). It’s a joyful event to be able to meet you all!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The young boy looked honest without any falsehood in his words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Looking at this boy, it was really hard to imagine that there was actually a dispute for the throne between him and Franco going on right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps this boy himself wasn’t really aware of what was actually going on.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Good grief……looks like it will be troublesome no matter who between these two will succeed the throne. That sly old fox……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The second prince Franco was 17 years old. The third prince Pedro was 13 years old. Both of them were close in age to Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although each of them had their own faction, there was nobody better than Baldr to ask each of these youths their true intentions.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     These two princes were also already feeling more curious rather than wary toward Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Someone younger would be able to reduce the wariness of the other party better than someone older. Even the royalty of another country wasn’t an exception to this tendency.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Most likely, King Welkin who appointed Baldr to be an ambassador had estimated this point.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It certainly couldn’t be helped for other people to call that person a scheming fox.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Regardless whether Baldr intended it or not, being able to approach the royal family like this should bring him various opportunities to obtain information or interfere with events. Baldr had the duty to make use of the information he obtained and bring benefit to the Mauricia Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr wanted to hold his head in vexation because of this excessively troublesome situation, while beside him Teresa kept smiling widely and staring passionately at Franco.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In response Franco also wasn’t feeling displeased by that gaze. Rather, it felt like the blood circulation in his face sped up instead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">

   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How humiliating! How can they act servile to a mere ambassador of Mauricia!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The military minister Marquis Santacruz(サンタクルズ) couldn’t hide his fury from being excluded from the greeting that Mauricia Kingdom’s ambassador was giving to the king.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed that other than the royal family, only the prime minister was permitted to attend it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Santacruz had been vaguely feeling that the king was trying to weaken the power of the military, which had become too strong. It seriously stimulated his sense of danger.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At this rate, the military would be unable to be involved with any important decision-making. They would only go down the path of decline like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was something that couldn’t possibly be allowed by any means in order to guarantee the safety of Sanjuan Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Even though those Trystovy bastards are letting the pirates act as they please because they’re affected by the civil war……good grief, that war amateur doesn’t know anything!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     By war amateur, he of course meant his king Carlos.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     King Carlos was competent as a politician, but his talent in naval battles was nonexistent. He repeatedly lost even against the Trystovy Dukedom’s fleet that should be exhausted from civil war.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At present Sanjuan Kingdom was able to exert influence on the Marmara Sea more than they should be able to due to their alliance with the Majorca Kingdom. They also had the hero Diego de Morias(ディエゴ・デ・モリアス) who took command of the naval battles in the place of the king.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If only that hero didn’t die young, they might not be in this mess right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Diego had continued to win many naval battles with his uncommon ability in tactical command. He got sick on his beloved ship and died on it before a competent healer from land could arrive.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps that way of dying could be described as suitable for the hero who refused a promotion to military minister due to his fixation on fighting on the front lines.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the death of Diego who could even reach the seat of prime minister if he so wished for it undoubtedly left a great hole in the cohesive force of the military.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In addition, the prime minister Joan who was also a member of the navy in the past died.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even the military wasn’t formed with nothing but combat units.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rather, the organization called the military needed the ability for intricate political negotiation even more than the administrative organization. It was for securing budget from those administrative bureaucrats.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps Diego chose to remain at the frontline because he hated those kinds of secretive and ugly politics.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, as the one who was entrusted with the military at the present time, Santacruz couldn’t possibly remain clean like Diego. He had the duty to protect the livelihood of his subordinates. There was no way he could accept the decision to reduce the post and number of personnel in the military.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bureucrats would sometimes take action that ran counter to the national benefit in order to protect the interests of their own organization. But even Santacruz, who was famous as a brave general who cherished his own subordinates on the battlefield, couldn’t stay unaffected by this chronic disease of bureaucrats.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……I have to put his highness Pedro on the throne no matter what……though it’s troubling that his highness himself is still too young and useless……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In that case Pedro still had value in being used as their puppet.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The world couldn’t go with everything going well for the convenience of the people living in it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Nobles and bureaucrats were already gathering under Prince Franco’s banner. Even if the military chose to support Prince Franco now, their share of the pie would be too small with how late they entered the faction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In order to protect the military’s interests, they had to outmaneuver Prince Franco and make Prince Pedro the crown prince no matter what.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The problem was, unlike the nobles in the palace, few people among the military officers had the skill for this kind of political maneuver.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Spreading gossip, bribes, honey traps, appealing to the duty and humanity of other people, mobilizing people for taking care of troublesome dodgy dealings. Santacruz who was involved in the government as the military minister wasn’t good at those kinds of things.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because those who originated from the military grasped the instrument of violence called the military, they tended to prefer dealing with things directly rather than playing with roundabout methods to solve problems.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Call Bartholomeo here.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Santacruz rang a bell to call his secretary and gave him a short order.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The secretary who knew the name as the leader of the military’s secret intelligence unit looked tense from nervousness and bowed deeply toward his superior.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo de Cervantes(バルトロメオ・デ・セルバンテス).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Cervantes House was originally a mid-level noble house in Sanjuan Kingdom. Several generations ago they were embroiled in a political strife and fell into ruin. Bartholomeo was born from parents who only had high pride despite living a life that was even poorer compared to the commoners.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He learned to steal in order to fill his empty stomach when he was a child. Before anyone knew it, he became the leader of the young men of the city and dirtied his hands with even more crimes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But even with such a past, Bartholemeo didn’t become a fully-fledged resident of the underworld because his parents used their past connections and enrolled him into the military academy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, there was no way a man who didn’t hesitate to do anything for his objectives would be able to fit into a proper army.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was infamous for how frequently he entered the detention barracks, but he was very capable in individual battle and leading a small force, so he was able to safely graduate without expulsion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps it could be said as some kind of miracle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After graduation, it was decided that he was to be assigned to the liaison department of Sanjuan Kingdom’s navy. It was an intricacy agency under the direct command of the military minister──its nickname was Akaishi Agency.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The agency was responsible for illegal activity like information gathering, guerilla wars, drug deals, assassination and kidnapping. Bartholomeo who was ordered to join a covert unit like this was truly like a fish that had found water.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He immediately distinguished himself and formed an espionage network that was formed from the lower strata people in the capital. He also succeeded in raising illegal funds from drug and smuggling.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had an external appearance that clearly looked suspicious by anyone who saw him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had a broad forehead and eyes with the sclera occupying the majority. It made him look like a cruel looking reptile. He was slim and had long limbs, showing a surprising degree of agility. On top of that he was also a master of disguise. He could also change appearances into a very kind looking stall owner, which made this person even nastier.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Are you calling for me, your excellency?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter how many times Santacruz heard it, he couldn’t get used to the monotone and dark voice of this man. He lightly grimaced in displeasure. This man was a convenient man to have, but physiological revulsion wasn’t something that could be suppressed with logic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How many people can you mobilize in the capital right now?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Around twenty people if it’s the puppets. If it’s the puppet masters then at present……there are three.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Santacruz didn’t even try to hide his bitter expression and glared at Bartholomeo. The number of people who knew of their existence was limited even in the army, the elite assassins of Akaishi Agency, the 『puppet masters』.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Why so few?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo didn’t even falter against the gaze of Santacruz who reigned at the center of the army and chuckled in amusement.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Most of my subordinates are assigned missions in other countries and at the borders.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For a military, most of their enemies were foreign forces. There was no turn for them inside the country except to maintain public order or disposing traitors who tried to reach another country.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was only natural that there were few members who could be mobilized in the capital.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Santacruz’s face blushed with anger because this man was making fun of this situation where he had to turn fellow countrymen into enemies.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You don’t need to think of anything unnecessary.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「By your will──it’s a trivial matter as long as food and work keep coming my way.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Wealth that he couldn’t possibly own even if he served as a knight for his whole life and prey that he could turn into an unspeaking flesh bag by his own hand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As long as he was provided with those two things, he wouldn’t shirk at all even if he was forced to do an inhumane job.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To push everybody else than him into misfortune, and to squeeze out riches and life from everybody else other than him were the greatest joys in Bartholomeo’s life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Santacruz stopped even trying to hide his scorn at Bartholomeo and spat out his next words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Prepare some skilled men. If you can guarantee the secrecy of this matter even if they’re alive or dead then I don’t mind even if you use outsiders. There is also no limit to the funds you can use. Kill the second prince Franco Cordoba de Sanjuan as soon as possible.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I shall give everything I have to accomplish this task.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Failure is not allowed. In the slightest chance that you fail this, there will be no place for you in this country forevermore.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I humbly accept this mission.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo’s expression that was blank like a Noh mask smiled widely like a good-natured old man.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a content smile that looked truly happy without the slightest malice that could be felt from it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Bartholomeo, it was desirable for his target to be a person with a blessed life. The higher their status the better it would be.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If the second prince who had the seat as the next king within his reach was to fall halfway in his journey, he could only imagine how great that person’s regret would be.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     While he was feeling exaltation from obtaining the ultimate prey, Bartholomeo was also starting to rack his brain calmly of how he would assassinate this VIP.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course, he didn’t have the slightest intention of conceding the special viewer’s set for the prince’s death to another person.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 6
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After the audience with the king, Baldr and his group rested in the inn that had been prepared for them. Franco visited them in the evening there.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The unexpected visit surprised Baldr, but this was also a rare chance if he considered his mission.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     With how close they were in age, they could have fun having small talks with each other easily. When the topic turned into the matter of the water pump, Franco spoke with a bright expression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Baldr, can you let me accompany you for the pump installation tomorrow?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「But of course! I’ll tell you everything about them!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Eh, right……I’ll be in your care.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa vigorously replied from the side without even giving any time for Baldr to answer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The docile Franco was unable to deny Teresa’s good will.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No, rather her frank good will was tickling him even if it was embarrassing. Even so he didn’t feel any unpleasantness at all from her behavior.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco felt like there was a part of him somewhere in his heart that was happy from this. He couldn’t really form words exactly like he thought when he was in front of Teresa.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He turned to face Baldr once more while fidgeting restlessly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If there are any other places in our country that you want to see, I want you to tell me without any reservation.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The death of the crown prince, and then the thousands or tens of thousands of victims from the contagious disease──in order to clear away the dark wind blowing through Sanjuan Kingdom right now, they would grasp even at straws.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr also wouldn’t be reluctant to lend his help here if it was within his power to do so, in order to make them owe him a favor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If it’s your highness Franco’s request, I won’t be reluctant to take one for the team……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I told you to stop with the formality……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No no, as expected please spare me from that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr would mercilessly call Prince William without any honorifics when he went home, but as expected he didn’t have the courage to easily call the prince of another country without honorifics.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「T-t-t-then can I call you Franco?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Y-yeah……I don’t mind, Miss Teresa……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco’s face reddened and he nodded against the pressure from Teresa, who brought her face closer with a rough nasal breathing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please call me Teresa too!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「U-understood……Teresa.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Control yourself already, Teresa……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr held his stomach that was attacked by a dull pain. Brooks and Oliver were staring at him with pity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 7
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena’s lips broke into a smile when she heard the report that her son Franco and the ambassador from Mauricia Kingdom were getting along well.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although their faction was at an advantage due to the support of the nobles and bureaucrats, it was still painful to have the organization of violence that was the military turning into their enemy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If they could obtain the support of Mauricia Kingdom, then it would become a great advantage for Franco in order to hold the military in check from doing something reckless like launching a coup.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena took a stroll through the garden in a good mood. Then she caught sight of a familiar silhouette walking through the corridor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oh, are you heading somewhere, Maria-sama?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Isn’t this Elena-sama, how do you do on this fine day?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The first queen Maria was walking through the palace corridor. Elena’s lips twisted in pleasure when she caught sight of her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria who was wearing a black mourning dress while heading somewhere. Elena had an idea of where her destination was, but she couldn’t help herself from asking Maria intentionally.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I have received a call from his majesty today, so I plan to visit Abrego’s grave earlier before that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria casted her gaze down apologetically.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Not only were Elena’s expectations betrayed, but Maria was also unconsciously showing to Elena that the affection of the king still hadn’t left her. She became speechless in humiliation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria with her petite body and humble attitude also looked like a tidy woman who quietly supported her husband.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Elena was thinking of Maria as a terrible bitch who led men around by the nose.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Carlos didn’t favor Elena, who was strong minded with strong political intentions, because he believed that he shouldn’t let women have any authority. It was the result of the education he received as a monarch growing up in regards to governing the country. But it was impossible for Elena to have that much consideration for other people’s circumstances.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph! Just be careful that your other son won’t be infected by disease too!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena left that sharp parting remark before turning around with loud footsteps.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She questioned why her husband was only affectionate to that kind of mediocre woman.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena wasn’t inferior at anything when compared to Maria, whether it was beauty, influence, or education. Far from that, she should be overwhelmingly superior when compared to her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was just a little girl who was only accidentally born in the royal family of a small country. She only had good luck that the position of the first queen of a big country like the Sanjuan Kingdom could fall in her lap.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     On top of that, that woman’s son also took the right to inherit the glorious throne of Sanjuan. It was completely unforgivable.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Recently, his majesty’s vitality and stamina were remarkably weakening.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If by any chance his majesty got cajoled by that woman, then she would become unable to be picky with her method.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Perhaps I should consult with father……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If it was her father who was the viceroy of Cordoba, he might teach her a good idea.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena herself would never acknowledge it, but in the first place she didn’t have her own personal subordinates, connections, or funds.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What she had was only bottomless malice and a persistent fixation on grasping authority.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even her father and her son were starting to be unmanageable for her, but Elena herself didn’t notice that at all, not at the slightest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For example, Elena’s first idea was assassination. If it failed then it didn’t matter how influential her family was, it was a gamble that could bring the risk of destruction in one night.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Without the backing of an organization at a national level, only someone beyond help who didn’t know their own place or someone who was so cornered they could see no other way would make that kind of gamble.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena who wasn’t aware of the danger to her own life was the stereotypical example of the former case.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Though perhaps it was exactly because she was someone like that, that it was impossible for her to become an existence that was a clear danger toward others.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 8
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The people who lived in Cadiz were watching the work on the street corner with great interest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The supervisor for the job of installing the hand pump was Prince Franco on paper.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr and his group hid their status while accompanying Franco as mere engineers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For the Sanjuan Kingdom that was located in the south and near the sea, wells were a precious existence.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If by any chance a well became impossible to use, it was possible that a single village would be gone from the number of deaths in the worst case.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although this was a work that was sponsored by the royal family, a troublesome looking tool was going to be attached to their precious well that was their lifeline. It was natural for the people to be concerned.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The number of wells in this Cadiz that was near to the coastline was limited, so a strict limit for drawing water was imposed on the citizens.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The prerequisite here was completely different from Mauricia where it was possible to obtain abundant water if people just dug in the ground for several meters.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was exactly why the introduction of the hand pump should be a revolutionary convenience for them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the first place, Baldr was only bringing in something that was already completed, so the work was finished very quickly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s finished with this. What’s left is only to pump using this handle and water will come out.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Baldr pulled at the handle that was curved like a bow, water poured out from the tap vigorously.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The spectators who saw that let out a surprised cheer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Water! Water came out!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Amazing! Drawing water will be easy from tomorrow!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Drawing water was a job that was entrusted to women and children that weren’t the main workforce, but it didn’t change the fact that drawing water manually was still really hard work. Especially for children, this work was seen as a kind of torture.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It would be easy to understand if one tried to imagine just how hard it would be for a small child to pull up a bucket full of water from the bottom of the well.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Next, if you put the bucket on this wheelbarrow, even a child will be able to carry water to some degree.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco added to Baldr’s explanation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The royal palace will lend a certain amount of these tools to each city. We won’t spare any effort if we can ease the people’s life even if only slightly with that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Thank you very much!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sanjuan Kingdom banzai!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was a slightly sly method to raise popularity, but it was also a fact that the quantity of the work force had decreased due to the disease.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The people naturally rejoiced that the royal family was reducing their burden.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Besides, Franco was greatly popular among the masses as the clear white handsome youth. The effect of this popularity stunt was outstanding.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──There were multiple gazes staring at Franco.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The sources of the gazes were wearing various disguises. They were vigilantly searching for an opening to prey upon Franco.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, there was one reason that made them hesitate to attack.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was the fault of the person who was moving around Franco irregularly all this time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Franco is really popular among the commoners.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Y-yes……even though I don’t have any authority myself……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No. The people understand Franco’s beautiful heart that is thinking of them.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     One person always attempted to do skinship with Franco every time there was a chance and praised him exaggeratedly like this, so even the sniper found it quite hard to fix his aim on Franco.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This person was of course the sexual harassment devil……aka Teresa.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco responded to the cheers of the people by waving his hand. Beside him, Teresa caught sight of beautiful flowers decorating a street stall.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The flowers seemed to be a variety of golden-rayed lily. Its size was only half of the standard golden-rayed lily, so perhaps it was a variety that was only grown in Sanjuan Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Boss, give me a bouquet of that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「R-right……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The stall owner who was suddenly addressed by a young man who had been acting friendly with the prince hurriedly prepared a bouquet of the flower.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As expected, it was impossible for common people to see through Teresa’s gender in the first meeting.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After Teresa who had been getting in the way finally went away, the sniper with his crossbow at the ready fixed his aim toward Franco’s head and took a shooting position.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His finger rested on the trigger. At the moment he was going to fire the arrow──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa returned and her finger casually touched Franco’s hair. A white flower was put on Franco’s glossy red hair as decoration.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It looks good on you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As she expected, this flower really suited Franco.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa smiled in satisfaction. Franco got bewildered and groaned with a hoarse voice.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Just what’s wrong with me?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was unbefitting for a royalty like him to be flustered with a clichéd coquetry of this level. Even though that should be the case…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「T-thank you…………」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He could only say that just barely. Franco blushed bright red up to his ears from shame and broke out running to escape from Teresa. It was unbearably embarrassing for him to stay together with Teresa like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was at that timing that a merciless arrow passed through the space where Franco had been standing just now with a sharp sound akin to something slicing through wind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Gazu-* The arrow pierced a stone wall with a dull sound. The guards who witnessed that immediately turned their attention to the direction where the arrow came from.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, it never happened in the history of Sanjuan Kingdom for a member of the royalty to have their life targeted in the royal capital so brazenly in broad daylight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That negligence made the bodyguard knights give a half-baked reaction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The attackers weren’t so amateur to miss this opening that only lasted for a moment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If the surprise attack failed then they would go with an assault.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Following the plan that had been decided beforehand, the men in disguise attacked the knights.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In addition, the windows on the second floors of the building around them broke, horse-drawn cabs stopped on the street, and the figures of people appeared.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The knights couldn’t help but fall into confusion from the sudden emergence of so many assassins baring their fangs.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Each knight was attacked by three people. The knights would at the very least get injured. And then the attackers splendidly accomplished their objective to not let the knights pursue Franco.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The number of knights who were assigned to be Franco’s guard was too few to smash this systematic attack.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──However, that was only limited to the knights of Sanjuan Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was Baldr and Brooks who reacted the fastest toward the assassins whose number surpassed their allies overwhelmingly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The vanguards of the assassins who believed the cover story that they were engineers dispatched from Mauricia couldn’t mount a decent opposition toward the two’s completely unexpected counterattack and were mowed down.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Good grief, could it be that I am really cursed?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr massaged his forehead in frustration. Brooks immediately retorted at him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……I can keep telling you that if you still don’t get just how cursed you are, you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I just don’t want to accept it. This isn’t caused by any youthful indiscretion from me, though.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was uneasy inside his heart in contrast to his light tune.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was late in chasing after Franco due to the suddenness of Franco’s action.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa was following after him as though she was spurred by her instinct, so it would be alright because she wouldn’t be defeated by assassins of this level, but…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I have a really bad premonition……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco was still royalty, furthermore he was the front runner when it comes to being appointed as the next crown prince. These people were assassins sent to assassinate such a big shot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seeing how they chose to perform this kind of assault, they must have some kind of trump card.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr held a certain level of trust toward his instinct──or rather toward his ability to sense danger.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
<img width="50%" src="img/054.jpg"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He couldn’t feel relieved with his sixth instinct loudly telling him of danger like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In addition, the opponent was someone with the capability to hide his killing intent and presence to the point that even Baldr couldn’t sense it. It was an even greater source of unease.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Don’t you die out there, Theresa.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The assassins who perceived Baldr and Brooks as greater threats than the knights rushed toward them one after another.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr held a sword with his right hand and a knife with his left hand, casually stabbing two of the assassins at the same time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was slaughtering assassins with this merciless attack, but this way of fighting was far different from his original style.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s movements that were clearly focusing on simply killing might be indicating just how anxious Baldr was more eloquently than anything.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 9
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Due to him reflexively saying his true feelings due to Teresa’s sudden surprise attack, Franco was driven with shame so great he wanted to hide in some hole.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I was blushing and saying thank you because a girl put a flower on my hair and told me it looked good on me? Just what’s wrong with me! I want to redo it, I want to treat it like it never happened, or rather I want to die!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, Teresa’s face crossed at the back of his mind. Franco shook his head energetically while his entire face turned red.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I’ll become no good if I keep thinking about it! I’ll stop becoming me!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──*Shiver*.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The chill that stabbed into him like a block of ice that was inserted into his back might be the work of his survival instinct.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco unconsciously ducked and turned around toward the feeling, like there was something sharp and cold attacking him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was a death god over there swinging a sword toward him happily.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco held his head and yelled like a child toward the lethal slash that was approaching before his eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had trained in swords routinely, to a level that wouldn’t embarrass him as royalty.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco had a slender build, but his skill wasn’t inferior compared to the average knight by any means.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However Franco who was shown the absolute reality of death approaching him couldn’t think of any way to resist.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Over my dead body!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The assassin’s slash was deflected with a clear metallic sound.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The girl who came running with rough breathing glared at the assassin with her whole being.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even with body strengthening, she would need to muster her strength from the deepest part of her body in order to face this powerful enemy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ku-ku-ku……are you tired of living already, you damn brat?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I won’t let you lay a single finger on my lovely princess!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──*Throb*.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa’s gallant proclamation made Franco’s heart pound in his chest once more.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      Even though I’m a man
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ……
    </span>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      even though I should be the one who takes up a sword in order to protect her here!
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wondered why his chest felt this hot even though his life was in danger like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What a show!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo who was watching from a balcony by strengthening his vision was laughing so joyfully while holding a glass with one hand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The young man had really good eyes. Those were the eyes of a young man who never knew any setback and threw away his own life without any hesitation for the sake of his justice.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      However it’s too bad for you, the puppet master before you is the strongest or second strongest even among all of my subordinates.
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It didn’t matter how great the young man’s determination was, it didn’t matter what kind of justice he had, it didn’t matter that he had someone important to protect behind him. All of those were futile before unreasonable violence.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all, this world was made based on the law of the strong stealing from the weak.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa also wasn’t as composed on the inside as her lookss suggested.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although she had confidence in her skill, the skill of the man before her was undoubtedly superior than hers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed she had to be prepared to lose her life here in order to protect Franco.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I won’t let you die painlessly. I’ll let you watch how I reap that prince’s life.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Do you think a mere thug who attacked the princess can defeat the knight of justice?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That might be the case if this is a drama scene.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Life is a drama that god created. Don’t you know that saying?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two were exchanging fierce sword slashes even while having such cynical conversation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was impossible for Teresa to block all the slashes of the assassin who was clearly superior in skill.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her skin immediately got cut up in several places. Teresa’s white skin was dyed with fresh blood.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although she managed to barely avoid a lethal wound, Teresa understood from the exchange that if the assassin got serious, he would be able to easily inflict a deep wound on her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Too naïve, do you think my heart will yield with this?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      Hmph
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     , Teresa snorted and strengthened her grip on her sword.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was a hopeless gap in strength between the two, and then the increasing number of wounds was gradually chipping off her life. It was difficult to maintain her fighting spirit in such a situation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But Teresa knew.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of the existence of a Joker that could overturn this despairing situation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter how ugly or unsightly her battle was, she just needed to protect Franco successfully until that Joker’s arrival.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Stop! Stop already! What do you want? If it’s money then I can give you as much as you want──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seeing Franco crying and yelling made the assassin licked his lips in pleasure.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (That’s right. Struggle! Keep holding to that hope and despair until you go to hell!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s fine……I’ll protect you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa’s face was starting to turn pale from all the blood she lost. Even so she smiled.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     So that she could reassure Franco even if just for a bit.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Now this is unpleasant……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Unlike the prince who was the target, the other prey had been continuing to betray the man’s expectation since some time ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He should have understood the gap between their skills. This youth wasn’t so unskilled that he wouldn’t be able to.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And yet, not only did his fighting spirit stay unshakable, he was even harboring hope in this situation. The man found such an attitude unpleasant. He was extremely displeased.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Do you think you can stop this me with your level of skill? Or perhaps you’re thinking that your ally will come running to save you? Fool. All the guards have been killed to the last. It will easily take half an hour until the guards hear the commotion and comes running here.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From what the man observed, even his lowest subordinates who were composed of the poor people in the capital would be enough to defeat the bodyguard knights of that level.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then that just mean it’s my duty as a knight to protect my pretty princess for half an hour more.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ridiculous!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no need to continue tormenting a prey that continued to betray his expectations like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Before he fought with the aim of exhausting the opponent. But then the man changed his way of fighting to deal a fatal blow and attacked Teresa fiercely.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, Teresa’s calm expression didn’t change.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa’s face was commanding as though she was staring at a place even further beyond life and death. That face made Franco’s chest tighten and he became unable to hold back his overflowing tears.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please! Someone……someone save Teresa!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco joined his hands together to pray and squeezed out his words from his throat. It dulled the man’s sword tip slightly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Teresa? This fellow……is a woman?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man’s attack that aimed at Teresa’s heart stopped at piercing Teresa’s collarbone due to that miniscule hesitation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa fell backward like a marionette whose strings were severed. Franco reflexively caught her body in his arms.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although the assassin just barely missed her vitals, it was obvious from a glance that she wouldn’t be able to avoid bleeding to death at this rate.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……I’ll give you my life. That’s why please, give me time to treat her at the very least!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      What a joke,
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     the man snorted.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was different from his original plan, but this too was an ideal situation that he could enjoy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s fine……there is no need to worry……I bought enough time. It’s fine now, my beloved princess.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Teresa-! My knight!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa’s limply entrusted her body weight on the chest of Franco who was holding her tightly in his embrace. Her expression didn’t look frustrated at the slightest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Now…………I’m leaving the rest to you, Baldr.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa lost consciousness. At the same time, the man felt an overwhelming sword aura hitting his back and reflexively leaped to the side while turning around.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was a sword aura that came from someone who undoubtedly had taken countless lives. It made cold sweat pour out from his whole body.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Who’s that? That man……!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Bartholomeo who was elegantly watching the battle couldn’t help but yell at the completely unexpected appearance of a strong warrior.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Good job hanging on til’ now. Ye can leave the rest to me.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai woke up from his sleep because he sniffed the off-flavor of battle that only a warrior could understand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The thick smell of death that no ordinary person could sense──it made Sanai’s warrior blood boil.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Hou, so manslayers also exists in this world.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After cutting down the hitmen who held him back with a single sword and catching sight of the man who was pursuing Teresa and Franco, Sanai was convinced that this man was a genuine manslayer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore, the man wasn’t a mere manslayer, but a fallen manslayer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This man was a nasty type that devoured other people’s misfortune for the sake of his own pleasure──it was the type that Sanai hated most.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai had seen it with his own eyes many times, how men who were honest and simple at the beginning fell to be this kind of manslayer while wandering through the battlefields.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There were two types of manslayers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The first type was like this assassin. A type that could only feel they were really alive by taking away other people’s life. This type of person couldn’t help but kill people in order for them to enjoy their own life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But people who killed other people for the sake of pleasure like this man, all of them without exception would be deteriorating in character. That deterioration would appear in their sword without any way to hide it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A sword that was wielded for the sake of enjoying murder would never rival a sword that was wielded solely for killing humans.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A genuine life-taking sword that existed solely for the sake of killing humans.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A man called Kamiizumi Mondo Yasutsuna(上泉主水泰綱), a terrifying colleague of Sanai was a pure practitioner of such sword.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This taciturn colleague who obtained the favor of the Uesugi Clan was also a fallen man in a different meaning from the usual.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai could remember the figure of Mondo who died in battle at Yamagata very clearly, as if it happened only yesterday.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     With his terrifying strength, if he took his sword to a place other than the battlefield, then even Sanai with his skill would hardly have any chance to win. That was just how gifted of a swordsman he was.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Mondo had a mild-mannered appearance and in politics he belonged to the moderate faction. But Sanai was very familiar with him, of how much Mondo was a demon of the sword that shouldered the inescapable karma of cutting other men.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was said that Mondo was the grandchild of Kamiisumi Nobutsuna, a sword saint and the founder of Shinkage style.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When speaking of Kamiisumi Nobutsuna, his disciples were a gathering of truly distinguished master fencers like Marume Kurando who taught the Taisha style at Shimatsu, Yagyu Sekishuusai of Yagyuu Shinkage style, Hikita Bungorou of Hikitakage style, and so on.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When thinking of the renown of his disciples later on, his existence as someone who reigned above them was enough to cause a chill.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Mondo himself was serving the Later Hojo clan together with his father, but he became a ronin after the clan’s defeat at Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s Odawara subjugation. After that he served Uesugi Kagekatsu right before the battle of Sekigahara.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There were other noted names like Kurama Tanba, Sai Douji, Sorimachi Daizen, etc. who also served the Uesugi clan at the same time period, but even among them Mondo gave off an extraordinary presence.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「A sword that cannot cut men has no value whatsoever.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Together with the end of the Warring States period, sword art was transforming into a part of a warrior’s cultivation in order to heighten their spirituality under the name of life-saving sword, the principle of how a killing sword may become a sword of life depending on how it was used. But at the time period when Sanai and Mondo lived, the sword was still a genuine path of manslaying. That time period could be said as the last era of such a path.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was because the inner mysteries of the sword, the logic of the blade was impossible to comprehend without cutting humans.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It didn’t matter how hard one trained using bamboo swords or wooden swords, the logic of the blade that was for the sake of cutting flesh and severing bone couldn’t be learned inside a dojo.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     One would reach closer to the logic of the blade the more one cut. Then continuing to cut people is my only path in life──Kamiizumi Mondo once declared that. Sanai knew nobody else who was a tragic genius at the level of Mondo.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then, it was exactly because Sanai knew of such a tragic genuine manslayer that he was unable to forgive the coarse manslayer before him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Enough screwing around. Ye art going to incur divine punishment for that, ye know?』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oi oi, this is a joke right?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though he was far away, Bartholomeo’s eyes opened wide while feeling cold sweat trickling on his back.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Was the one who released the killing intent just now really this small boy?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Bartholomeo who had experienced countless exchanges of lives until now had never felt a killing intent to this degree even once.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although that was also because Bartholomeo had only faced weaklings or an opponent who couldn’t display their true strength due to a crafty plan until now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The assassin who was facing Baldr directly was also unable to measure Sanai’s strength, although he had felt the killing intent just now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That face……you’re from Mauricia huh. This is an internal problem of Sanjuan. You will get burned if you poke your nose unnecessarily, you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      Depending on the situation you might cause international problems, you know?
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man threatened, but it didn’t move Sanai at the slightest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For a warrior, the option to sheath the sword and ask for reconciliation despite being the first one to raise the sword didn’t exist.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter what kind of problem would result from this later, it was a problem that should be resolved when that time came. It couldn’t be a factor to refuse this battle right now, when two sides had pointed their swords at one another.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Ye wisheth to escape after this late? Imbecile.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai spat out his words in displeasure.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    This man had targeted
    <ruby>
     a prince of a country
     <rt>
      Franco
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    , injured his
    <ruby>
     friend
     <rt>
      Teresa
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    , and ordered his subordinates to attack
    <ruby>
     him
     <rt>
      Baldr
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    . And yet, now he didn’t wish to fight?
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     On the other hand, while the man couldn’t comprehend the language that Sanai was talking with, he sensed how Sanai wished to stake his life and challenge him in a battle without any hesitation. That fact was more terrifying than anything to him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Most likely, this man would fight without even a single twitch, even if he were to be surrounded by enemies and fall into an absolutely disadvantageous situation.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was as if battle was Sanai’s life itself. The man was correct to fear him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Should I run──? No, that option doesn’t exist at this point.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To fail his mission would mean his death.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo always prepared insurance without any miss. There was no way he would be forgiven if he went back shamelessly after failing his mission.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Besides, if Franco’s faction went on to win like this, his organization wouldn’t be able to avoid destruction at the end.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wanted to rob Franco’s life somehow and retreat, but it would be necessary to remove Sanai by brute force for that to happen.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he turned his back on Sanai and rushed at Franco right now, he would surely get cut down with a single attack. Then he had to defeat Sanai at any cost.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was reluctant to risk his life on a battle this risky, but the man had the confidence that he would win if he fought.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Die, you brat!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man swiftly threw four knives.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then he ran right behind them toward Baldr with short swords in both hands.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Simultaneous saturation attack with four knives and twin swords──all the people he fought until now were unable to deal with this attack no matter how much of an expert they were.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The best they could do was only escape in an unsightly way but……there were additional throwing needles strapped on the man’s feet for pursuing an unbalanced enemy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course all of them were smeared with poison. The opponent wouldn’t be able to avoid death, even if they were only grazed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Making the first move with a surprise attack using hidden weapons and overwhelming the enemy with numerous moves, that was this man’s combat style.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Knights trained for one on one battle and group battles, but they rarely trained for battle facing assassins. After all there was a very limited number of situations where it was assumed that they would face an assassin.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was why the man held an immense confidence in regard to individual battle but…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「WHATT–!!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai easily hit the knife back towards the man, as though to say it was just a boring magic trick.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The poisoned knife that should be attacking the enemy was attacking him back. The man was forced to knock it down in an unsightly panic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Cold sweat poured out from his whole body with a labored breath. The man turned his gaze toward Sanai as though he was looking at a monster.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To be able to hit back the knife so accurately like this meant that Sanai had grasped the knives’ trajectory with composure to spare.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In that case, the man who didn’t possess a method of attack that was faster than the throwing knife already couldn’t find a method to win here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Impossible! That’s just impossible!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This defeat came too abruptly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man’s sure win method that was specialized in cornering the opponent by following the script was trampled by an absurdity that surpassed it. At that point he was already not allowed to take any other method.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (──It shouldn’t be like this. This me being turned into the weak one, that’s something that absolutely shouldn’t be permitted!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The stability of the man’s mind crumbled when his confusion reached the peak. He rushed toward Sanai without any hint of fighting skill as though to rant and rave at the absurdity he faced.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was the worst option to take as a fighting method when fighting someone stronger than himself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The childish reaction made Sanai lose interest. He swung down his sword without any motivation and smashed the man’s collarbone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But thinking back, he had never seen this kind of small scoundrel who wasn’t also an unsightly bastard.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That man──even a top ranked puppet master is beneath his notice.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo muttered to himself with a cloudy expression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The assassin that Sanai defeated was an expert who was considered top class even within his organization. His strength rivaled even Bartholomeo himself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Bartholomeo faced him without any tricks, then even he would have the tables turned on him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「A troublesome man has become an enemy. I have to think of an underhanded plan to kill the prince……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo’s cold eyes looked spiteful, like a snake’s. Even so he laughed fearlessly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if the method to assassinate the prince that he picked later wouldn’t need to harm Baldr, he would never forget to take revenge against Baldr, or rather Sanai.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rather, he swore that he would take revenge without fail no matter how much time it would take. This malicious persistence was none other than the most terrifying thing about Bartholomeo. It was also his nature that was beyond any help.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Teresa–! Get a hold of yourself, Teresa!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco clung on the neck of Teresa whose face was turning pale and cried without caring of how he looked to others.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa herself had only fainted briefly at relief upon Baldr’s arrival. Her wound wasn’t as bad as it looked.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She responded to Franco’s call and immediately opened her eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Franco……are you unharmed?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa smiled faintly because Franco was holding her in his embrace.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A knight who protected something important to her at the risk of her life. And then a lovely flower who accepted the knight’s feelings and had to let himself be protected.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yes, thanks to you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps it was inevitable for the two of them to be pulled to each other while staring at each other’s eyes and exchange a kiss.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The roles of the two in this scene felt like they were completely reversed, but at the very least this scene still made a very good picture.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I love you, Franco.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Me too──I love you, Teresa.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai watched the two youths embrace and ascertained their feelings for each other while frowning in a kind of discomfort.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I have felt that it is destiny at work when I first caught sight of you. Franco, I believe that there is the heart of a beautiful goddess within you……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I too had given up, thinking that perhaps my only choice is to keep living like this while continuing to deceive my heart……but after meeting you Teresa, I learned the joy of living exactly like my heart commanded!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wanted to dress like a girl, appreciate the flowers, and smack his lips in relish with sweet cake. And then he would fall in love with a gallant gentleman and yield himself to a sweet and dangerous temptation──who knew how many times Franco had imagined such wild ideas before.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, in front of his duty as royalty to have the next generation inherit his bloodline, his wish was something that couldn’t possibly come true no matter what.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore, with Abrego’s death, it was demanded from him to succeed the throne. He should have given up his dream at that time and accepted that he would have to live while deceiving his heart until he died.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the first time Teresa sent him a passionate gaze, he got the feeling that his true nature was seen through.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She treated him not as a prince, but like he was a lovely princess. It made Franco’s chest beat so fast it felt like his heart was going to burst. If he let his guard down even for an instant, it felt like he would forget anything and everything and entrust himself to Teresa’s temptation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     On top of that, she protected him that heroically and passionately. How could he not feel moved after that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco became a believer of the providence of god at this moment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If that wasn’t the case, then it would be impossible to explain this miraculous fairy tale in real life, of the existence of a woman with a man’s soul who would love him like a woman.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two even forgot that they had an audience and greedily devoured each other’s lips. It was difficult to describe this scene of the two of them with their tongues entwined with one another’s.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Masaharu absentmindedly muttered a single sentence in the place of Sanai, who didn’t have the vocabulary to describe this scene.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『It’s a trap and a reverse trap……』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 10
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After that, Teresa fainted again and she was brought to the palace. Franco never left her side for even a moment throughout all that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco was filled with a bloodcurling presence, as though he was claiming that he would never let go of this woman who understood him now that he had finally met her. His vassals who originally should be dissuading him were also unable to speak strongly towards him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Fortunately, although Teresa had lost a lot of blood, she would recover quickly as long as the wound was closed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To begin with, Teresa had confidence with her stamina. Rather it was a happy thing for her to be laid on a bed like this because now she could enjoy her tryst with Franco leisurely like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Teresa. Here, say aa~~~n.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aa~~~n……it’s delicious, Franco.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After the doctor left the room and seeing that the surveillance had been relaxed, the two immediately acted like an idiot couple. Baldr’s stomach was cornered to a state of near destruction from the stomachache.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Certainly, Teresa was his best friend. And even if he searched through the whole continent, there was no way he would find any man more suitable to be Teresa’s spouse other than Franco.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Congratulations, I hope you two can be happy. No matter how much he congratulated them it still wouldn’t be enough to celebrate this miraculous encounter between the two. However, he had his duty as an ambassador who represented Mauricia Kingdom’s interests here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    Just from thinking of how many political obstructions that these two had to overcome in order to be able to marry peacefully, it made Baldr want to yield himself to the temptation of taking care of everything with violence, just like what his
    <ruby>
     mother
     <rt>
      Maggot
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    would do in his shoes.
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But the two people in question only ignored the conflict Baldr was feeling and were getting heated up by themselves
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I want to see you in dress quickly, Franco.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I also want to dress up and show you myself in my best appearance, Teresa.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When they reached this point, as expected even Baldr couldn’t put up with it anymore.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You two idiot couples! Pay attention to your surroundings for a bit!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No, Baldr……you also can’t say anything about other people.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Brooks, thank you for the calm retort……tears are coming out.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Good grief, what Teresa and Franco were doing wasn’t mistaken at all for a couple to do but……he wondered why it made him feel such a great headache watching them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Were these two actually aware just how dangerous the present situation was?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr thought that at least Teresa didn’t understand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If this woman had such laudable senses, she wouldn’t have come along to this country in the first place.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     With their age and status, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the fate of Teresa──and also Baldr and the others was relying on Prince Franco’s capability.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr glanced at Franco who was fawningly rubbing his cheek on Teresa. All strength left his body and his shoulders slumped down in dejection.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Franco-niisama, are you alright!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was at that timing the third prince Pedro appeared with a face that was pale from worry.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The way he was looking so frantic with worry for Franco couldn’t possibly be an act.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Eh…………」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Pedro froze in that panicked posture.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed his brain came to a halt when he saw the surreal scene of his big brother acting spoiled towards a woman.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (This damn idiot couple, this is why I’m telling you two to be a bit more mindful……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……W-what are you doing? Nii-sama?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fuwah?? P-Pedro! Turn your gaze away!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Y-yes!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco yelled with blushing cheeks because he was seen being embraced by Teresa.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Pedro who saw that also noticed that he had seen something that shouldn’t be seen and turned his face away swiftly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Spare me……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Of all things it’s his political enemy that witnessed the decisive moment, what to do now……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was at his wits’ end but──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Nii-sama is also a man so……that, I mean, congratulations!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      Eee, you’re accepting it like that?
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr desperately suppressed his impulse that wanted to retort like that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Unbelievably Pedro easily accepted Teresa becoming Franco’s lover.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps he had learned a weird kind of resistance from knowing how lecherous his dead brother Abrego was.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even so, who in the world dares to attack Nii-sama in the capital? Unforgivable!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Just when it seemed like Pedro had finally calmed down, he recalled why he came here and started to feel enraged.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr who imagined that there was a family quarrel between the brothers couldn’t help but feel bewildered and looked towards Franco.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Then Franco replied while smiling wryly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Well, you might be unable to believe it, but my relationship with Pedro as his brother isn’t bad. Perhaps it’s because his age is far too distant from Abrego-nii, that’s why he has been closer with me from the beginning.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Pedro’s natural earnestness came out clearly from his expression. It made Baldr feel like a dirty adult seeing that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There is nobody else besides Nii-sama who can be the next king! Why can’t the others understand that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Pedro’s amiable looks made him seem like a small animal.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Actually, these were Pedro’s honest thoughts. He had a reserved personality after living under Abrego’s shadow for a long time until now. He also didn’t really believe in his own talent.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Pedro couldn’t match his biological brother Abrego whether in knowledge or martial arts. Franco who was talented in everything and cautious in personality was a target of adoration for him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Conversely, Pedro’s good-natured personality was a bit too meek for him to be a king.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You’re really a good boy, Pedro. However, the world cannot be that simple.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco and Pedro were treated as the representatives of the two major factions within the palace. The thoughts and hopes of the two themselves were only secondary for other people.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Pedro who was supported by the military was forced to be Franco’s rival regardless of whether he wished for it or not.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Nii-sama, I don’t want to become a king or anything……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What a coincidence. Me too.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If it was Abrego, he might be able to regulate the confrontation between the civil officials and military officials wisely.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His womanizing habits were almost the worst, but that eldest brother was discerning in regards to the subtleties of people’s hearts.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But the fetters of the civil official and military official were sticking tightly on Franco and Pedro’s backs. The fetters were so heavy that they couldn’t do as they pleased.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If one of them became the king, conflict between the two factions would be unavoidable.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For them, to still accept becoming the king even knowing that such a future would come to pass, was like volunteering themselves to shoulder great hardship.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「So the problem is that no one believes that both of you seriously don’t wish to become the king.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The seat of the supreme position that anyone should be yearning for.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Someone who was born into the royal family and yet didn’t wish for that awe-inspiring status. There was no way those people whose eyes were blinded by authority would believe that such royalty existed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The biggest example of such people was Franco’s mother Elena.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Well, if I can be married with Teresa, then I won’t ask for anything else.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Franco……!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Teresa……!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Nii-sama……I pray that you two will be happy forever!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Someone please do something about this chaos!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The couple flirted for nearly one hour without caring about other people’s opinions and disregarding Baldr’s anxiety…….
