    Chapter 4 – The End of Darkness
   </h1>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 1
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A storm of lavish praise and congratulations was waiting for the combined fleet that returned home to Majorca Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It couldn’t be helped.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanpaniradeon were the pirates among pirates that rampaged around the sea and turned three countries into their enemies.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Not only did the combined fleet crush them, but Sanpaniradeon even surrendered and accepted being a subordinate. It was an event that was like a heroic tale to be sung by the minstrels.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore, the main actor of this event was Tormenta Negra, who was greatly famous even among the commoners. It was only natural for the people to be boiled up in excitement.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria imagined that her beloved cousin would surely return with a triumphant grin on her face, but she immediately noticed that her cousin was acting strange.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca was waving her hand back at the people who welcomed her home, but her heart obviously wasn’t in it. Her gaze was wandering around in search of someone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──And then she noticed that the target of her gaze was Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She continued to stare at Baldr in a daze while her cheeks were flushed with a rosy color. And then before long, she would look like she suddenly came back to herself and went bright red up until her neck. After that, she remove her gaze from Baldr in a large manner that would also make her body face another direction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria was staring at such Urraca with great amusement.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I can only root for her like this!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She didn’t know what kind of change of heart Urraca had gone through, but there was no doubt that the season of love had finally come for her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 2
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The celebration had fresh seafood and fruits lined up in abundance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The main star of the celebration was obviously Urraca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Normally Urraca would be proactive in this kind of party and get a bit wild, but today she was only giving everyone a business smile that lacked her usual liveliness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, it made her allure as a woman rise by several levels, so the audiences were delighted to watch or interact with her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria was congratulating the growth of her younger sister from the bottom of her heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ufufu……you seems to be bored, Urraca.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「T-that ain’t true at all, Maria-nee.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca turned toward the cousin who she couldn’t go against and waved her hand. Her behavior looked suspicious.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The organizer of the party would lose face if the star of the party was looking bored.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Urraca knew that much.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then that’s good but……here, I brought you your favorite pineapple ale.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「T-thank you!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed Urraca was finally freed from her nervousness when she saw her favorite drink. Urraca gulped and began to drink the chilled fruit ale in one go.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sorry that the glass is Baldr-kun’s old glass though.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Bufuuuuuuuuuh!*
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oh dear, that’s nasty.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Gehoh! Gofuh! Ma-Maria-nee, what just now, what did you……!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I was just congratulating you for for your first indirect kiss with Baldr-kun, you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Huh, huh, huuuuuh!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca spat out her pineapple ale from shock. Then Maria’s words after that made her shout, also causing her entire body to turn red.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seeing how her cousin lost her composure so completely like this reminded Maria of her black history, those times when she caught a snake or a crab to bully Urraca when she was little.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (This child……come to think of it, it was really fun to bully her when she was little……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca had grown up and she was also blessed with genius talent, so no one remembered, but she was a girl who was really easy to instigate and her personality was really amusing when she was teased.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m really curiouuus……the reason how Urraca can become a cute maiden like this, I’m really, really curiouuus……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Maria-nee, your true color, your true color is showing!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca felt a chill on her skin seeing the dark smile that Maria sported. At the same time, she admonished Maria who was a queen of a country right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ah, no good……as thanks, I’ll teach Urraca the ace up my sleeve later.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It doesn’t seem like it will be anything good so I’ll pass.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Most times it wouldn’t become anything good when Maria showed that kind of expression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca had learned that by heart since she was a child.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sheesh, is it really okay? Even though it’s my sure kill trump card that allowed me to win his majesty Carlos’s heart……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──What did you say?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria and Carlos were greatly in love with each other, and in the end, they were happily married. Even Urraca had heard about that story so many times she got fed up with it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If her memory was correct, it was King Carlos who proposed marriage to Maria at that time…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     On that subject, a memory of the past revived inside her mind. There was one time when her grandfather said that he got caught in her grandmother’s sure-kill technique.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca unconsciously gulped.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Do you want to know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca’s head nodded up and down wordlessly. It was like she was being entranced by the devil.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Come to my room later. I’ll teach you everything there is to know about this secret sure-kill technique that mustn’t get leaked to outsiders.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria’s eyes narrowed in delight and she showed a brilliant smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca finally reobtained her courage from Maria’s words. She finally recovered her liveliness to enjoy the party. Originally, she was also someone who loved this kind of party too.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oi, Kailas! Come over here and pour me some drink. Just so you know, I still haven’t lost against you!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sheesh, you really don’t know when to give up.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The nerve! I’ll make you dance naked when you lose against me in a race!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The party heated up even more when Urraca came back to being her energetic self.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though she was a maiden who froze up when facing the man who was her first love, she had a type of charisma that only appeared once every hundred years.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「She is really cute……so simple and gullible.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If she could see the wicked smile that Maria sported at that time, Urraca would surely regret her choice.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria’s mischief would end in nothing good most of the time, however no matter how much she raised her guard, Urraca would still get cajoled before she realized it and end up going through unpleasant experiences. She had experienced it many times in the past.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca gulped down alcohol in a good mood. She still couldn’t even imagine what tragedy was waiting for her in the future.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ufufu……the sure-kill technique to catch a man, that is by making a fait accompli. There is no other way than that! If only I can show her……Carlos’s pale face when he woke up in the morning at that time!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca’s body shivered at that time from the cold chill that she felt. However she didn’t understand the cause of it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For some reason Urraca’s animal instinct could never work at all when it came to Maria.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Come on drink, drinkkkkk!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The local elders who had known the two since they were children let out a long sigh. They lamented the misfortune that would befall Urraca after this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Judging from the expression on Maria’s face, there was no doubt that she had just gotten an idea for an exceptionally malicious game.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although, they didn’t have the guts to warn Urraca about it and turn Maria into their enemy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 3
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr slipped out from the party and reached the bed that was prepared for him when around midnight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ugee……I don’t feel good……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wasn’t like he was weak against alcohol, or rather, he liked drinking, but it was a party that was attended by big shots. That meant he couldn’t really let loose and get pleasantly drunk in such a setting.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In order to cool down his flushed body, he opened the double windows that were facing the sea. The refreshing sea breeze pleasantly caressed Baldr’s silver hair.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The wind is nice……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The southern country Majorca was hotter and more humid than Mauricia, but the temperature difference between noon and night was large. He felt like the night here felt more chilly than Mauricia instead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was then, *knock knock* he heard the sound of the room’s door getting knocked hesitantly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Come in……?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Now then, who could be coming here this late?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He left behind Teresa and Brooks at Sanjuan, so there shouldn’t be any friends of Baldr here in Majorca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「B-Baldr, you’re still awake?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Eeee? Urraca-dono!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The one who appeared was Urraca, wearing fascinating night clothes that dazzled his eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was an adult’s black night clothes. Her huge breasts that couldn’t be fully hidden by the clothes jiggled and displayed the deep valley between them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That overly provocative figure made Baldr back away with a blushing face. There was no doubt that Urraca was drunk right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Wh-wha, what’s with that appearance! At the middle of night like this!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……? It’s because it’s night, so it’s natural to wear a night clothes isn’t it?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This person is no good! She is a child who grew into a still childish adultttttt!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed she was seriously not seeing Baldr’s point and only tilted her head cutely. Baldr seriously considered running away from here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He didn’t have the confidence to properly talk and convince Urraca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Muu? I’m not a child! Look! Even my breasts are several times bigger than Maria!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Maria heard that line, she would beat Urraca until she was half dead. Urraca puffed out her splendid chest to show them off.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The devilish breasts that rivaled even Rorona made Baldr unable to stop himself from gulping unconsciously.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「A-anyway, an unmarried woman shouldn’t visit a man’s room in the middle of the night like this. If you have business with me, I shall come to you to enquire about it tomorrow, so……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「W-wait!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca hugged Baldr’s right arm swiftly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s heart shouted with exultation at the plum and soft feeling that was pressed around his right elbow.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Unfortunately this softness wasn’t something that he could experience from Selina, and of course not from Seyruun.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s……i-it might be too late to say this but……thank you for saving me the other day!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca wrung out those words from her mouth while her forehead bumped on Baldr’s right arm. He wasn’t so heartless that he could push her away in this situation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr sighed in amazement while hugging Urraca’s shoulders like he was interacting with an adorable little sister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m happy that I could be useful for Urraca-dono.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca pinched Baldr’s arm painfully. She might be offended by those words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Stop calling me Urraca-dono! Just call me Urraca!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「As expected, I can’t bring myself to call a countess and the navy minister so informally……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I told you it’s alright! I’m not going to let go if you don’t listen!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (How childish this person is!?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr had her breasts pressed even harder on his arm. He immediately got outlasted by the opponent’s persistence and yielded.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Got it. I understand, Urraca. That’s why please, let me go.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It felt really good, but there was a time when a boy shouldn’t feel good!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Then Urraca closed her eyes as though she was ruminating something before she leaped at Baldr’s chest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then she turned her gaze upward toward him with moist eyes, but unfortunately Urrca was taller, so her posture looked a bit too forced.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You were very cool at that time, Baldr. It was the first time since I was born to have my heart stolen by a man other than my Ojii-sama.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Eh……could it be, this flow of events……?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──M-make love to me! I love you!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a straightforward confession from such a stunning beauty. There was no man alive who wouldn’t be shaken by this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, his danger sensing level that had reached an instinctual level just barely managed to make him desist from embracing Urraca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, the sweet smell of coconut was drifting from Urraca’s black hair. Her sensual thighs were stimulating Baldr’s lower body. They drove his rational mind mad.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Dangerous! It will be really bad if this continues!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he allowed Urraca to continue persuading him with her body language, Baldr might get swallowed by the temptation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「T-this one isn’t working? If this is no good then next is, err~……you can do anything you want with my body! I don’t mind even if it’s just one night, make me into your woman!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was really a hopeless girl, which made her even more adorable.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From those words, Baldr accurately discerned who it was that put the idea of doing this into Urraca’s head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no doubt that little devil was imagining Urraca’s silliness in joy around this time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wondered how such a mother could give birth to an honest and lovable young boy like Pedro.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seeing that Baldr wasn’t really reacting like she hoped for, Urraca started to spout even more suggestive lines.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From the tone of her voice, it seemed she herself didn’t understand the meaning of what she was saying.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Since a while ago……the inside of belly feels really hot! Please free me from this aching!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That line is a bit, you know……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    She was undoubtedly a beauty, but how should he say it, her
    <ruby>
     aura
     <rt>
      sexual allure
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    was decisively lacking.
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Use your xxxxx to stir up my xxxxxx into a mess!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That damn auntie, just what is she making Urraca saying!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr reflexively averted his gaze from those lines that would make other people who heard them undoubtedly misunderstand her as a female molester. He also felt indignation rising inside him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a secret that his lower body was reacting slightly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fill my xxxxx with your xxxxx!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You’re getting even worse!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (To make this naïve Urraca going this far with her lines, Queen Maria, you’re a real demon!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Marry me to take the responsibility of impregnating me!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I haven’t impregnated you, also, that’s what you’re actually aiming for in the end, huh?! Damn it!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At this time, Baldr’s eyes could clearly see the form of the graveyard of men.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two’s station would make it politically difficult for the two of them to be with each other, but if there was a fait accompli, Baldr definitely had to take responsibility.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria’s plan was effective in that regard. If they set aside the form of the method taken that is.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Put your sticky xxxx into my gaping open xxxxx……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Why are you returning back to that again!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Why?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The 『lines with exceptional effect for taking down men』 that she heard from Maria weren’t showing any effect toward Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No, at first they were really effective. His lower body was also reacting (it seemed it was found out).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Now that it came to this, although she didn’t want to use it, she could only appeal to him using her last method.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Prepare yourself, Baldr. I don’t care anymore what method I use in order to have your child!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No, you should care about that! The child will be really pitiful if you don’t!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It doesn’t matter what kind of child will be born, I’m confident I’ll be able to love them if it’s your child!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca never showed any reaction in that kind of thing except towards her grandfather. This was her only chance to be pregnant with a child.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if she searched throughout the young men of marriageable age all over the world, there was no way she would find any other man who had the heart of an old general in their heart like Sanai.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s why sorry. If you sniff this specialty secret medicine of Parma, you’ll fall asleep right away. Don’t worry, everything will be over when you wake up…………guu」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Bum*, Urraca fell on the bed head first.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed she made a mistake and inhaled the sleeping drug herself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This woman is completely disappointing to the end……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ‘Kuu kuu’ Urraca slept with an innocent face. It was impossible to imagine the numerous bouts of silliness that she displayed just now when looking at her face right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Well, she was just instigated by her majesty Maria though.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, some people said that the stupider a girl was, the cuter she would be, and indeed, he believed it would be really difficult to find any other woman as cute as Urraca.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Though that cuteness was reserved only for the position of little sister or buddy position at best.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr stared at Urraca’s tranquil sleeping face while realizing that he was also getting sleepy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (No good……but, well it’s fine I guess. Urraca will surely return to her senses when the morning comes.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Just in case, he made Urraca sniff the secret medicine once more. Then Baldr himself also couldn’t resist the sleepiness anymore and his consciousness was swallowed into darkness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 4
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Urraca woke up in the morning, there was Baldr’s face that was illuminated by the morning sun in front of her eyes. The memory of her silliness from the previous night was welling up vividly inside her mind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「K~~~YAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then she hid her reddening face with both her hands and rushed out from Baldr’s room in full speed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr smiled wryly at her reaction that was exactly like he expected. Even so his mouth broke into a smile at Urraca’s innocent reaction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I sa~~~w it!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──Only until the voice of an adorable demon came out though.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His gaze moved toward the direction of the voice with stiff motion like a rusty tin toy. There, Maria was standing with a triumphant smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yo……ur……majesty Maria……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The freezing chill that he was feeling right now wasn’t at all inferior when he was faced with a fight against that
    </span>
    <ruby>
     mother
     <rt>
      Maggot
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rather, this person felt even more wicked because he couldn’t think up any countermeasure.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How naughtyyy……to share a bed together with an unmarried woman, this is a shocking scandaaal……!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What is the person who gave the sleeping drug to Urraca saying!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr realized his own blunder.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Most likely, everything was going just as this person planned, even this kind of result too.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「By the way……since when your majesty was watching?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ufufufufu……perhaps from around the part when Baldr-kun called me auntie, I think?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In other words she saw everything!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How very regrettable. Just what is it that you’re dissatisfied about with Urraca?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There is nothing satisfying about almost getting reverse raped!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even though getting through it somehow is where you show your worth as a maaan!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「So is it okay if, for example, something like this had happened to King Carlos?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr didn’t overlook the blood vein that bulged on Maria’s forehead with a snap.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──There is no way something like that can be forgiven. If that person lays his hand on a young girl while ignoring me, I’ll kill him before killing myself!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s just too horrible in various senses!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Then what was going to happen to me, who had fiancées waiting for me back home?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria might have noticed the meaning of Baldr’s gaze and she scratched her head awkwardly with a wry smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ehehe~~. Well, I’ll have Urraca-chan polish her femininity up a bit more……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A demon would be a demon no matter what.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was convinced of that when he saw Maria’s wicked face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll record the image of Baldr-kun and Urraca-chan sleeping on the same bed……so you owe me for this okaay?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was vexing to obediently listen to her, but in the slightest chance such an image was shown to Selina or Seyruun, or even worse, if it was shown to Maggot, his life would be in danger.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s shoulders slumped with his head hanging down. He could only surrender completely with a sorrowful expression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m begging you to please keep this a secret…………」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 5
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The information about the successful subjugation of Sanpaniradeon also reached the Sanjuan Kingdom capital Cadiz quickly. A grand celebratory mood was fermenting among the people, especially the merchants.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, there were also people who were unable to go along with that mood.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The second queen Elena should be said as the foremost example of those people.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What are they so proud about after winning against mere pirates!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What was displeasing for Elena was that she didn’t know how this subjugation of Sanpaniradeon was the condition for Majorca and the military to become Franco’s ally.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although the number of people who knew about it was extremely limited. Not counting the king and Franco, there were only several other people who knew. Rather, it was only natural that Elena didn’t know.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because of that, even a victory like this had a different meaning for her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The military was considered as Pedro’s biggest backer up until now. In addition, Majorca Kingdom was his mother’s birthplace. Elena interpreted this as the Pedro faction accomplishing a great achievement with great publicity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In fact, the interpretation of the general public was also the same as Elena’s.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The wind had been blowing against Franco since he announced his engagement with Teresa. In contrast, with this achievement it looked like the military that was Pedro’s backer was gaining influence rapidly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It couldn’t be helped that Elena was having misgivings.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「At this rate……at this rate, that two-faced prince will be the king……!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena bit at her lip until it was almost bleeding.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria was always making a demure face, but her true nature was that of a savage that was inferior even when compared to the dirty commoner.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     How was Maria able to survive until now within the palace that was filled with intrigues and underhanded persecution plotted against her?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was the effect of Maria’s strength as a capable magician, and her personality that skillfully paid back anyone who tormented her with twice the torment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Elena, who was the very picture of arrogance, had only been making snide remarks towards Maria recently. That was because she was scared against Maria’s revenge if she got serious.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The most horrible thing was that time when Elena’s closest followers were completely annihilated by a mysterious disease. After that, no one would get close to Elena for a while.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Elena who couldn’t feel superior without anyone fawning over her, the loneliness she felt at that time was a very painful memory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「His majesty too. Why can’t he see through such obvious two-faced acting……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Unfortunately, Carlos wasn’t unaware of Maria’s true nature. Or rather, it should be said that it was already too late when he noticed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Either way, Elena was pressed to take some kind of action.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At this rate, Maria would become the empress dowager without her being able to do anything about it. She couldn’t bear it due to the resentment of many years piling up within her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even so, father is also unexpectedly a coward……if only those two are dead, then this country will be ours to do with as we please……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena was already scheming to borrow the power of her father, Duke Cordoba, to assassinate Maria and Pedro. However, this plan met with a setback due to her father’s firm opposition.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Isn’t there anyone here with a good connection……I don’t understand the matter of the lower classes!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Anyone was fine. If they could just erase those two from the face of this planet with certainty.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She didn’t care how much money or treasure she had to spend. If needed, then she would even offer some noble daughter around her to be used as a slave.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If only Maria and Pedro could be killed!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her eyes that were containing madness inside glinted. Elena was demanding an intermediary to such service.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A bit later after that, a commoner maid who was adopted into a merchant family from a certain orphanage provided Elena with the information of a certain hidden organization.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 6
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo, who had finished his discussion with Santacruz, learned that the military couldn’t become their backer any longer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was the fate of an illegal organization that stayed in the shadow.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, Bartholomeo wasn’t so meek that he would just stay quiet while waiting to be cut off.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At this rate, when the military could unite for one purpose internally, they would consign all members of the Akaishi agency into darkness in order to hide the evidence.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The subordinate organization for gathering information had been already separated from Akaishi agency and reorganized to be the military intelligence department.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In such a situation, Bartholomeo had just barely succeeded in gathering his subordinate field agents to the capital.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He did so because it would be difficult to resist the attempt to dispose of them one day if he kept them dispersed to the remote regions just like Santacruz ordered.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Now then, who should I choose to be my master next…………」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     First, the military was out of the question.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Akaishi agency was attached to the navy, but the army was also under the jurisdiction of the military minister, so it would be useless even if he went to another branch of the military.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Next option would be the royal court. It would be best if he could serve under the prime minister or the king, but Bartholomeo didn’t have any connection with the royal court.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although he had a noble background, he didn’t have any connection with other nobles since his family was ruined.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Then, what about serving under a merchant?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There were a lot of wealthy merchants who didn’t care about their method for the sake of obtaining money. Working for them might provide his organization with a lot of work, but they didn’t have the military might or political influence that could cover Bartholomeo and his men from the military’s pursuit.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Then should he just go further and build an assassin guild by himself?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was also really difficult.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had no shortage of field agents, but if he started up an organization in his current situation that was lacking in money and customers, he would only end up getting embroiled into a conflict with another similar guild.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Above all else, it wouldn’t be useful at all for their objective of escaping the military’s pursuit.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo was continuing to plan calmly like this while gathering information from his few civilian cooperators.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he could be hired by a minister with the rank of duke or at least a marquis, they might be able to obtain protection from the military.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo had the confidence that he would be absolutely useful for dirty work.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the information that reached his ears wasn’t favorable for him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The military and Majorca were getting closer to each other, the subjugation of the Sanpaniradeon pirates──that victory must be the impetus that made Santacruz decide to cut ties with Bartholomeo.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no time──if he didn’t find a new backer immediately, Santacruz would definitely attempt to destroy the evidence.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The only reason Bartholomeo was still let alive like this was because the possibility for Prince Pedro obtaining the throne still hadn’t completely disappeared.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sir, I obtained some strange information……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Several days later, an old-timer information broker named Kasim visited Bartholomeo.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wasn’t a member of Akaishi agency, but he had known him for long as an external collaborator.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was slightly greedy for money, but Bartholomeo highly evaluated this man’s information gathering ability.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This is the first time I heard you call an information strange. What kind of information is it?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yeah, it’s about the second queen looking to hire assassins. I thought that there is no way she would do something like this so blatantly, but……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You’re saying that this information accurate?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「At the very least, it’s true that the queen’s maid is looking around for a pro killer. I probed deeper thinking that perhaps this is some kind of investigation, but I didn’t find anything like that at all.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a horribly amateurish attempt to search for an assassin, but there was almost no mistake that the queen was looking to hire a pro killer. That was what Kasim was saying.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The second queen huh……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She should be the eldest daughter of Duke Cordoba, a foolish woman who had the king’s affection taken away from her by Queen Maria.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed that foolishness hadn’t been cured even now, but she had a first-rate status that could be used as his backer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Guess I’ll give it a try.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Unfortunately, Bartholomeo had no way of knowing it at this point of time, there was already an agreement between the king and Franco to remove Elena.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Connect me with the client. This will be the deposit payment.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo said that and carelessly threw a bag that was filled with a hundred gold coins at Kasim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s an honor to be allowed in your majesty’s presence. My name is Baron Ares de Pielagos. I’m extremely delighted for the privilege of being able to revere the countenance of your majesty the queen.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The status of baron Pielagos was an actually existing peerage that was bought by the Akaishi agency to be used for work.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because it was a real noble name, the possibility of the alias being discovered was low.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Why is a baron from the countryside like you undertaking shadowy work like this?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The story of that is a disgrace to our family, but several generations ago my ancestor started this business for money. Even so, I guarantee that my family’s ability is number one even throughout the whole country.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo, who was disguising himself as a baron, brazenly puffed up his chest and recited some honeyed words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was an inhumane person and lacked even the slightest amiability, but if it was necessary for his mission, he could display a manner and eloquence that wouldn’t lose even against a first rate royal court noble. That was a terrifying aspect of this man.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I hope that boast of yours is backed up by reality. If it’s money then I shall provide you with as much as you want.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Pardon my rudeness, but I have no need for any reward at all.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man bowed with an exaggerated gesture. Elena’s eyes widened slightly at his words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What do you wish for, if not for money?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I wish for your majesty to bestow your patronage to this lowly servant. Even after his highness Franco has ascended to the throne, the need for this kind of dirty work won’t disappear by any means. I swear that I shall be useful for your majesty.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hou…………」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps she had unexpectedly picked up a good find.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena renewed her assessment of this man.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although for this woman, her evaluation of someone’s value was based on whether they could satisfy her selfishness or not, so this wasn’t really that big of a deal. However, at the very least Bartholomeo was able to win over Elena’s favor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I shall grant you your wish on the eve of your completion of this mission. That hateful Maria and Pedro must not continue breathing, by any means.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena laughed loudly in elation. Bartholomeo couldn’t help but feel disdain for this woman inside his heart, but on the surface he bowed his head deeply with false gratitude.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I swear an oath here that I shall deliver a good news to your majesty.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Umu, recently the royal guards within the palace have been annoying. You shall slay those two before they enter the palace.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「As your majesty wills it.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Before, it would have been possible to assassinate them even inside the palace. But since the assassination attempt on Franco, the security inside the palace was greatly reformed by the royal guards.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore Bartholomeo had no backing from the military right now. He could only act freely outside the palace.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I don’t think that my force is lacking but……to do this outside the castle, I might have to take care of that brat too.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had already obtained the information that Queen Maria was accompanying the triumphal return of the navy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Then, Prince Pedro would also come to the harbor to welcome his mother. It would be best to attack them together at that time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The troops, especially the marines that were specialized to operate on tightly shut ships, weren’t suited for something like guard duty.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But the young man named Baldr who was present at Prince Franco’s assassination attempt was weighing heavily in his mind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he was facing a knight, he wouldn’t feel any fear no matter how skilled they were. Their way of fighting was too specialized for wars or duels.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But that young man was different.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His eyes were the eyes of a manslayer who had cut down hundreds of humans.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Those were the eyes of a killer who devoted their life to cutting down humans.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As expected, even Bartholomeo wasn’t confident he could win if he fought that young man.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But, that was also exactly why he wanted to try to fight him. After all, there was nothing more pleasurable than defeating someone who thought of themselves as powerful.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 7
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「We finally arrived…………」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Urraca who was awakened to her first love was continuously toyed with by the wolf in sheep’s clothing Maria. Baldr was completely exhausted when La Mancha arrived at Cadiz.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Baldr-kun, this is for the sake of Parma House. We won’t ask you to acknowledge the baby, so please at least……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Baldrrr……I’ll do my best to be a woman of your dreams, so……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「L-look there! His highness Pedro is coming to welcome us! Let’s talk about that again later!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr wanted his mental strength to be praised for enduring this situation to the end.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I want to go home quickly and flirt with Seyruun and Selina……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was what people called a flag.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Baldr was going to get off the ship after La Mancha came alongside the barge, an unpleasant chill ran through his back.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (What’s this……this discomfort……?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In front of him should be just a very normal sight of the port.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Other than Pedro and his guards who came to welcome Maria, there was only Brooks at the port without Franco and Teresa in sight. This might be the decision of King Carlos. To be honest, this decision was really helpful.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A cart that was grilling seafood, travelling merchants selling dried fish. The adorable children who used their pocket money to stuff their mouth with shellfish grilled inside its shell.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And yet, what was with this discomfort that was strangling his chest?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a common port that could be found anywhere with the hustle and bustle of a lively street. There was nothing here that should be making Baldr feel as uncomfortable as this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    『……The smell of
    <ruby>
     grass
     <rt>
      ninja
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    .』
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai’s words unconsciously came out from his mouth. Baldr realized the situation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Your majesty, behind me! Brooks, protect his highness Pedro!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「O, oou!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the same time as Baldr’s order, an armed group assaulted from the shadows of the buildings to the left and right.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The bodyguard knights of Pedro unsheathed their swords in a panic and fought back.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Brooks! Be careful! These guys might just be bait!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Whaat? Then, where the hell is the real enemy at!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Brooks involuntarily became flustered from Baldr’s warning. But it couldn’t be helped.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If an unknown armed group appeared out of nowhere, anybody would naturally become on guard and focused against that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so fortunately, the number of the knights surpassed the number of the mysterious enemy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Fighters crossed swords in various spots. The citizens and children who were unluckily present here screamed and ran about in panic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Kyaaaaaaaaah!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A girl who got dragged into a sword fight got kicked by the knight who was fighting. She crouched on the ground and bawled her eyes out.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I-I’m sorry. Are you alright?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Looking closer, she was just a little girl who hadn’t even reached ten years old. The knight moved the girl behind his back while asking for her condition worriedly but──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m alright but, it doesn’t look the same can be said for knight-sama.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The girl happily and joyfully drove in something long and drill-shaped into the knight’s neck.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「E-even a little child is an assassin!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That wasn’t all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A knight was kicked flying toward a cart after a scuffle with an enemy. The cart owner who had a twisted cloth tied around his head as headband raised his thick butcher knife for some reason and struck down on the gap in the armor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「W-what? Even the cart’s owner is also an assassin!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Where are we? Isn’t this the capital Cadiz? And yet how can assassins be lying in wait so meticulously around us like this?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     All the citizens who were running around in confusion looked like enemies. It greatly shook the knights’ focus.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the first place, they had never even imagined fighting terrorists who disguised themselves as citizens.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     An assassin climbed on top of a cart to take advantage of the chaos and rained down arrows on the knights. The ring of knights protecting Pedro was falling apart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uwah! Wawawawa…………!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Should he run or fight? A man got down soundlessly behind the flustered Pedro, like a shadowy figure that was emerging from the moonlight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「One down──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man casually swung his hand, even then it was undoubtedly a skilled attack that would take a life without fail.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Brooks immediately moved on to cover for Pedro, Maria was starting to chant her magic, but they could only see Pedro’s death approaching.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was then──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『This is why sneaky assassins doth not suit mine fancy.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a forward step with a godspeed acceleration that not a single person here could perceive.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In addition was the abnormal physical strength that couldn’t even be imagined coming from the small body of a boy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo’s critical hit was stopped just an inch from Pedro’s neck.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Irregular battles instigated by ninjas who disguised themselves as civilians also existed in the Warring States period when Sanai was alive.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai’s master, Gamou Ujisato, originated from Oumihino that was near the Koga Village. The Uesugi clan that he later served possessed a powerful ninja group that was called Nokizaru.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, their battle was different from the glorious open battle. Their battles also tended to become something gloomy without any compassion or mercy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was why Sanai couldn’t come to like them despite being aware of their necessity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Tsk!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo wasn’t fixated with assassinating Pedro and immediately took some distance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo had never missed a perfect chance like this even once in his life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He didn’t intend to underestimate the boy’s martial skill, but it seemed this boy hadn’t shown his full power in the battle the other day.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph, I wonder how long you can keep that indifferent look?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If it was impossible to win one-on-one, use numbers to crush the opposition. If it was impossible even with numbers, use a hostage or poison. That was how those who lived in shadow fought.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wouldn’t take that much time for his subordinates to annihilate the knight order that was at the height of confusion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In that case, he only needed to hold back this boy and his subordinates would kill the targets.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Ye hath forgotten the mother.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo couldn’t comprehend Sanai’s words, but he understood that the boy was denying his words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It seems you are unwilling to admit defeat but……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo’s subordinates were sent flying with a blinding flash at that timing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──What the?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was undoubtedly the explosion of magic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Bartholomeo’s subordinates weren’t so incompetent or foolish to just resign themselves to be hit by magic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Who in the world was using grand magic on such a scale that his subordinates were unable to dispel?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t look down at the magic power of the sea priestess!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was Maria, who was scattering blasts of flame with a brute force approach using her enormous magic power. Such an amount of magic power could even be called tyrannical.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Unfortunately, Bartholomeo never saw Maria fighting a battle, or the actual capability of someone who was called the greatest genius of magic since the founding of Majorca Kingdom before her marriage.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if he tried to defeat Maria directly, Urraca and Obar were in front, protecting her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If she tried to fight them head-on, it was obvious he would be the one who would be defeated by magic next.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In addition, the flashy explosion caused a loud sound that spread throughout the capital. It was only a matter of time before the guards flooded this place.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo instantly realized that the tables had been turned on him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「To think I will be defeated above the stage even after planning with great care like this……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Stage was a secret word of the Akaishi agency. It referred to the site where the gambit to assassinate the target was set up.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The stage had failed even after he invested almost all of his force on it. With this, the Akaishi agency would never regain their strength like in the past anymore.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo was forced to realize that the dream he had constructed until now was crumbling.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He already lost his backers and fighting force. What was waiting for him was only his crime and judgment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s mortifying……at the very least I’ll defeat you to balance the accounts of my life.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was also the option of running.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was also the option of surrendering and negotiating.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However at this time, at this instant, for the first time Bartholomeo became aware of the subconscious desire that was hidden inside his soul.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wanted to kill, but that didn’t mean he would be satisfied by killing some random nobody.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wanted to kill a noble person, or an unruly powerful person. He wanted to disgrace them, humiliate them, to make their whole life meaningless.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was why he didn’t become an assassin for hire but joined the military instead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This silver haired boy was blessed with martial talent. He had a dazzling way of life and was loved by fate. For Bartholomeo, this boy was a prey of the finest quality.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was worthy to decorate the last moment of Bartholomeo’s life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Witness the essence of my valor and skill!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, regardless of what Bartholomeo thought, for Sanai he wasn’t a warrior that was worthy for him to cross swords with as an equal.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Purely as a manslayer, the assassin who tried to kill Franco was still more of a warrior compared to Bartholomeo.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The reason was that it wasn’t Bartholomeo’s true nature to cut down humans. He didn’t care for his method or whether he did it personally or through his men when killing someone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps the samurai was looking down on ninjas during the Warring States period also because of the influence of such a sense of values.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Sanai, Bartholomeo was nothing more than a lowlife that he would cut down.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Come at me, ye dog!』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fine. It will be my greatest pleasure to disgrace a conceited bastard like you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo was delighted instead from Sanai’s disdain for him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In real battle, many times the underhanded method would surpass the right and proper method.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If the two of them fought a honest fight against each other, Bartholomeo would never win against Sanai even if he challenged him a thousand times. But there was no right or wrong in battle. He would teach him as a souvenir on the way to hell.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Cometh, I shall play with ye.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo suddenly threw iron needles without any warning sign beforehand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Surprise attacks were the thing that he was the best at.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course, it didn’t just end with iron needles.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He threw his mantle toward Baldr to block his sight, then he took out a tube from his chest pocket.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The tube contained a powerful poison. The tube was tampered so that it would burst and scatter the content around.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the end, would this boy be able to avoid the scattered liquid?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『A trivial prank.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai scoffed in exasperation from the bottom of his heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man believed that he had secured his safety with a petty trick like blocking the opponent’s sight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was an arrogance that was often found from those who didn’t have the experience of fighting someone stronger than them and narrowly escaping death.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When facing someone who was clearly stronger than oneself, the first thing one had to do was run away.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If there was a reason why they couldn’t run away no matter what, they had to throw away their own life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was because it was difficult for the weak to win against the strong, but it was possible to throw away their own life to take down the opponent in a mutual defeat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then occasionally, it was only when someone had abandoned their own life, that a fortune that could only come from the death god would be waiting for them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was the miracle on the other side that any veteran commander who had survived the battlefield must have experienced at least once.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Bartholomeo, who had only fought someone weaker than him, had no such thing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since the iron needles were thrown, Sanai had taken a stance to accelerate and rush forward. Only his sword that was stabbed into the ground was barely stopping his body from exploding forward. Then, he released his strength.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai’s body was transformed into a streak of light, like an arrow that was fired from a bow.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai surpassed the limit of dynamic vision and rushed like a blowing wind. Bartholomeo was unable to perceive such movement.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      Now come.
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      With the volatility of this poison, you won’t get away alive if even just a little of it touches your body.
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      What’s wrong? Why aren’t you moving?
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      Also, why is it this dark around here even though it isn’t night………….
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His upper body slid down to the ground. Without even knowing what had happened, Bartholomeo departed to the same world where he had sent so many people to in the past.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 8
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The assassination attempt on Maria and Pedro didn’t succeed, but for some reason the military declared their support for Franco. Because of that, Franco was recognized as the crown prince without any opposition.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There would be a banquet for it tomorrow. Elena was absorbed in choosing her attire for that event as though she was in the springtime of her life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Finally, she would obtain the position as empress dowager that she dearly wished for, becoming the most exalted woman of this country.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Haha-ue, you don’t need to choose your attire for tomorrow.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From behind Elena whose cheeks had loosened to form a sloppy expression because of her cheerful mood, she heard a familiar voice that resounded very coldly in her ears.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「W-what is it Franco!? Even though we’re mother and son, there is still this thing called decorum that has to be followed!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco treated Elena’s indignation like a mere passing breeze while glancing at the innumerable number of dresses that were thrown around on the floor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How pointless……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Pointless!? What do you mean by pointless!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      Even though I’m looking for a dress that wouldn’t shame you during your big moment,
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     she was about to say that when she finally recalled what Franco just said.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If she didn’t hear wrong, he seemed to say that there was no need for her to select a dress…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「D-don’t tell me the faction of that woman is doing something uncalled for?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena interpreted Franco’s words that she didn’t need to select her dress to mean that the banquet tomorrow was cancelled.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s not the case. It’s because I’m asking, Haha-ue to go home to the Cordoba territory today.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena didn’t understand what she was told and tried to smile, but her stiffened face only warped strangely and the expression she made was far from a smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「D-do you think you can tell your mother such a thing? I am going to become this country’s empress dowager, you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「At the same time, Haha-ue is also the mastermind of the assassination attempt on Queen Maria and Pedro.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco’s voice was filled with sadness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was a foolish woman, but there was no way that he didn’t hold any emotion towards his blood-related mother.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was why Franco came personally instead of telling someone else to tell Elena of her treatment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「S-such a thing! I did that for you──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Does Haha-ue believe that your crime won’t be questioned if it is for the sake of your son? Even if your crime was an assassination of royalty?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was the law that the punishment for an assassination attempt on a member of the royal family was the death penalty, even if the culprit was also a royalty.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena turned pale when Franco pointed out that fact.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I, I am the empress dowager! There is no way I can be executed!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Elena kept believing to the end that she was special. That was the basis of her identity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She didn’t know of the option of admitting her crime and obediently surrendering.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Executing Haha-ue……is impossible. A scandal this bad cannot be announced to the public.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「See, I’m right!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena laughed smugly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Carlos wouldn’t live for much longer anyway. Franco would immediately be crowned as king, and as the empress dowager who gave birth to the king, she would regain the honor that she unfairly lost.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However Franco’s next words completely crushed Elena’s hope.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yes, Haha-ue cannot be executed. But in exchange, Haha-ue will be made to die in something that looks like an accident. Perhaps it will be by poison, or getting pushed down from the terrace, or falling from the stairs……either way, Haha-ue won’t be able to die a good death.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That terribly cruel verdict made Elena scream, causing her whole body to shake.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What are you saying toward your own mother……it’s that girl, isn’t it? That lowly girl is whispering unneeded words into your ear……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She wouldn’t recognize it. She would never recognize that her son Franco who was also the source of her glory would do something like killing his own mother.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Elena was subconsciously looking for an explanation of this from Teresa.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No one is instructing me. Your expulsion is the will of the nation, and it’s also the last kindness for Haha-ue.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In other words, this was also the decision of the king Carlos.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was at this time that Elena finally realized for the first time about the danger that her life was in.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She hallucinated about poison in her food, or perhaps there would be a man visiting her from the darkness and pushing her off of a balcony. Elena became half-deranged.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I don’t want to die──I don’t wanna!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If she died, she wouldn’t be able to enjoy tea, or watch theater, or put her arm through a dress that was in fashion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If only she could just live──if Carlos died one day, then perhaps she would be able to return to the capital once more.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That hope could come true only if she lived.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco put his hand on the shoulder of his mother who was trembling in fear of death and softly brought his lips to Elena’s ear.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please spend your remaining life in peace──I don’t wish to become a kinslayer.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 9
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The problem of the successor to the throne that had troubled the Sanjuan Kingdom for a long time was resolved and a modest banquet was held to celebrate it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Messengers were dispatched to every country to notify them of Franco’s formal status as the crown prince. Later on, an even grander banquet would be held with representatives from every country attending, so the people invited to the banquet this time were only those who could be called as relatives and the authorities in the kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Also, Elena’s figure couldn’t be found anywhere in this banquet.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Here is my crown prince Franco. I hope that all of you will also be as loyal to him as you are to me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Carlos looked like he was in an unusually good mood this time, as though he had gotten a load off his chest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I am still lacking in ability, but I shall offer my devotion to this country.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The one who said that while bowing at the waist in front of Carlos was Jose.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From today onwards, Jose would be taking up the post as the new military minister, replacing Santacruz.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Santacruz who was informed of this decision unofficially by the king only smiled without any pretension, as though the devil that had been possessing him all this time had left him. He then handed the official seal of the military minister to Jose.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──I’m sorry, but I’m relieved that this burden has left my shoulders. It’s thanks to you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Actually, Santacruz took responsibility for the assassination attempt on Franco by resigning without anyone knowing about it. He recommended Jose to be his successor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was a problem with how Jose didn’t belong to any faction, but with his distinguished service in subjugating Sanpaniradeon and Prince Franco’s high opinion of him, his appointment as the military minister was decided without any opposition.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It also seemed that since the failure of Franco’s assassination, there was no day when Santacruz was able to sleep soundly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Santacruz’s look had completely become haggard, as though he had aged ten years. To be able to retire without having his crime investigated could only be considered as a fortune for him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Isn’t this Baldr-dono, you have been very active recently, far surpassing my initial expectation of you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As a foreigner, Baldr was turning himself into a wallflower in this banquet. But then a bright voice came and a hand tapped his shoulder. It was the viceroy Rodriguez, who welcomed him at Malaga.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s all thanks to the precious information that Rodriguez-dono provided me before.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I won’t have any hardship if it’s possible to move the country with just that much information. Everything is because of Baldr-dono’s own ability.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Certainly that might be true, but it was still precious information for Baldr, and it was also a great help for him mentally.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all, Rodriguez didn’t have any duty to help a mere baron like him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Maggot-dono is surely proud to have someone like you as a son.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s expression unconsciously turned very complicated hearing those words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Maggot heard about the details of the case this time, it was obvious that she would explode into laughter and then commence his punishment. The case about Urraca was especially necessary to be kept secret, absolutely.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oh, Baldr-sama, so you’re here together with Rodriguez-sama.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria approached wearing a bright pink dress. She bowed in greeting to Rodriguez with a beautiful demeanor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The mask she wore to cover her true personality was truly magnificent.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Surely there was no human that could imagine Maria’s little devil version while seeing her acting innocent like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Isn’t this your majesty Maria, it’s great to find your majesty in a good humor.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Rodriguez-sama, have you heard? Even though my cousin Urraca is infatuated with Baldr-sama over there, he is treating her very coldly instead, you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (What the hell are you saying!?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In that moment, Baldr was driven by the desire to use the paper fan in Masaharu’s memory to give a good slap towards Maria’s small head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Unbelievable, you meant that Tormenta Negra is……!? These two will surely become a good match! How about having her visit our country soon to talk about this? Baldr-dono. This Rodriguez won’t be frugal in providing assistance……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Will you still say that even if my mother turns into an enemy?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Your majesty Maria, unfortunately these two are the heirs of their respective families and cannot leave their country. It’s unfortunate, but they are just not fated to be.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed like Maria was shocked by this extremely fast change in attitude from Rodriguez.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You better remember this, both Urraca and I are still not giving up!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maria left behind that parting threat and returned to the hustle and bustle of the party once more. She must be really shocked, because her true self came out a bit just now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The one who visited Baldr next was Franco.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco was forced to go around greeting the authorities in the kingdom as the guest of honor of the banquet and as the king of the next generation. He clearly looked relaxed without any tension when he came to Baldr’s side.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m sorry. You didn’t even have a single moment to take a breather until now……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s fine, it’s a secret only between us anyway……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all, the matter of Franco being a trap was a top secret that was known only by extremely few people around Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no way Franco could let the authorities know about that secret of his, so Baldr sent Franco a sympathetic gaze.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even so, to think that things become like this. I never even dreamed something like this before you came to this country.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was the crown prince with both the military and the nobles in his grasp.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had also found the ideal companion in the form of Teresa, even though he had thought that he would never encounter such a person for his whole life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the past, he was thinking of living quietly in the shadow of his big brother like a hermit, and yet now he was in such a position. Life truly was unpredictable.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the one definite thing in this was that Baldr was the greatest driving force behind his success in snatching this miraculous chance for himself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Without Baldr, he wouldn’t be able to marry Teresa. Even before that, he would lose his life first.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Considering that, he had a debt to Baldr that he wouldn’t be able to repay for his whole life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll just tell you this──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then Franco straightened himself and faced Baldr with the sincerity as though he was going to swear an oath to god.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「At this point of time, I and also Sanjuan Kingdom have a debt to you that we will never be able to repay. Just remember that my country and I am always prepared to repay this debt at any time, not only to Mauricia Kingdom, but of course to you personally.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Now that Sanpaniradeon had surrendered, the control of Marmara Sea belonged to Sanjuan Kingdom and Majorca Kingdom. Trystovy Dukedom could only go on the defense with this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Also, if the Sanjuan Kingdom and Mauricia Kingdom’s relationship was deepened with Franco and Teresa’s marriage, the security guarantee would be greatly improved.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was like Franco’s reign was already promising a bright future.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although even without being indebted like this, Franco intended to do anything he could if it was for the sake of one of his few friends.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……I’m happy to hear that, but it would be for the best if nothing happens where I have to borrow your strength like that, I think.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Besides, even with Franco’s strength, he still wouldn’t be able to stop a disaster like his mother, for example.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr sported a dry smile for some reason with an aura of grief drifting from his back. Franco tilted his head with puzzlement before he recalled something and continued talking.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Can you come to my room when the party is over?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 10
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After that, Baldr repelled Maria who came at him again and then he headed to Franco’s room when the time was almost midnight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Can I come in?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yeah, I’ve been waiting for you, Baldr. Come in!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco’s voice sounded excited like a child. Baldr tilted his head while entering the room.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then, he stood still with his jaw dropping open.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was a lady wearing a pure white wedding dress under the illumination of the chandelier. The lady was smiling happily with her hand holding a bouquet in front of her chest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The dress unexpectedly matched the red hair. The color was like that of a mystical flame fluttering in the air.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a sight that was like a beautiful painting that would make anyone sigh.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──If only the one wearing the dress wasn’t a trap, that is.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Does it look good on me?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If I’m asked whether it looks good or not, I can only say that it looks good but……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr wondered what was this feeling of lamentation was inside his heart, as though there was something that was weighing his heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      Kuh……both Sanai and Masaharu are……thinking that there is nothing wrong with this?
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the Warring States era when Sanai was alive, the existence of a beautiful looking boy that served to take care of their master’s sexual desire on the battlefield existed as though it was only natural. And Masaharu was Masaharu, he had read and watched many trap characters from various media.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even after realizing that he had no ally anywhere, Baldr continued to oppose the despair.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I’m……I’M NORMAAAAAAAAL!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
<img width="50%" src="img/261.jpg"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yo, what do you think? My Franco is really pretty, right?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His childhood friend, who appeared with a smug face, looked just as expected. She was dressed in a pure white tuxedo that matched Franco’s dress.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her flat chest and refined limbs that were trained as a knight really enhanced the male clothing she was wearing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr really didn’t want to acknowledge it, he didn’t want to acknowledge it from the bottom of his heart, but this beautiful pair looked perfectly well-matched. Even Baldr was forced to acknowledge it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……You look wonderful, Teresa.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You’re also wonderful, Franco……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You guys, I’ll head back if you two just want to flirt.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa and Franco stared at each other while heading off to a world belonging to only the two of them. Baldr retorted coldly at them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How surprising. I didn’t know that you’re this kind of boorish man.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa pecked at Franco’s lips before she turned around toward Baldr in dissatisfaction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……I feel like I can now understand the feeling of Brooks and the others when they are looking at me murderously sometimes.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s shoulders slumped. Teresa poured salt into his wound.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Certainly, it was really embarrassing to watch your interaction with Seyruun and Selina.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You’re the only one I don’t want to hear that from!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wanted to believe that at least he wasn’t as much as an intoxicated idiot couple like Teresa and Franco.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Well, putting that aside──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Suddenly Teresa laughed with a twisted expression as though she was going to cry.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a complicated adult expression that was a mix of sadness, melancholy, and love that she had never shown even once until now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Thank you, Baldr. Without you, I would never even come to this country and encountered Franco. In that case, I might have ended up marrying you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco was completely taken aback by that and he stared at Teresa.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed that even he had never heard this admission.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I like women, so I thought that I wouldn’t be able to marry properly. I also knew that father was hoping for me to marry you, Baldr. Actually, I was thinking that if there is no other choice, then taking that path might also be fine for me. After all, it was fun to stay at your side.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll beg off from something like that. You’re my best friend, nothing more and nothing less.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa chuckled happily at Baldr’s instantaneous refusal.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even I would only do that reluctantly if there is really no other choice. But I have met Franco. I can’t imagine being the spouse of anybody else other than him. But……the true form of our relationship cannot be exposed even if it killed us.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Regardless of anything, the king was Franco while Teresa was his queen.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It didn’t matter what the truth was, the two of them had to play their respective role on the surface level.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They had to do it for their whole life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    「Will you listen? We want
    <ruby>
     you
     <rt>
      Baldr
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    to witness the true marriage of the two of us.」
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This might be how Teresa wanted to settle the matter in her own way before she had to live while lying to her family, to the public, and even to god from here on.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr wasn’t so heartless that he would refuse this request.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then how about you two speak your vow to me? I can at least pretend to be a priest.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa and Franco grasped each other’s hand tightly and their gaze met before they nodded.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──I, Teresa, swear to love Franco as his husband until death do us part.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──I, Franco, swear to love Teresa as her wife until death do us part.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I shall recognize the vow of you two as husband and wife under the name of Baldr Severn Cornelius.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then Baldr lightly poked on Franco’s chest and strongly hugged his shoulder.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「And so, take good care of my childhood friend. No one will take her, even if you return her.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph! I hope you don’t underestimate the bond between Franco and I! We won’t part from each other until death comes!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Franco spoke firmly next after Teresa.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I will make your childhood friend happy without fail.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr felt a flood of emotion that was accompanied with a mysterious feeling that was like a slight regret and loneliness. He told the two of them with such thoughts in his heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Congratulations for your marriage.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 11
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s group finished the popularization and technical support of the hand pump that was their original duty, and also confirmed the fundamental matters regarding Teresa’s marriage into the Sanjuan royal family. Their stay for nearly one month had ended and they could leave for home with clear feelings.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Your visit to our country is like a fortune that only arrives once every hundred years. The gate of Sanjuan will always be open for you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m unworthy for those words.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     King Carlos personally came to see their group off, but even then there existed a stupid couple that didn’t care for the public’s eye as usual.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「My beloved, we’re going to part from each other temporarily.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「At the very least I shall visit your dreams every night until the day of our reunion.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa and Franco embraced each other tightly without showing any sign that they would separate from each other any time soon. When everyone there was about to run out of patience, the two finally kissed before separating.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa gallantly got on her horse. Franco continued to wave his hand at the back of his lover until her figure vanished beyond the horizon.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr and Brooks waited until the wall of Cadiz was gone from view before they started grumbling.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Still, to think that Teresa would really become the wife of the crown prince.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「To be honest, I still can’t believe it even now.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How rude. It has been our destiny to be together since our birth!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa puffed out her chest without any hesitation. Baldr thought to himself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Certainly, with how low the chances were for Teresa meeting a man like Franco, their encounter could be called a miracle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps in that light, the two of them really fated for one another.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Perhaps I have to admit a little, just for this time, that fate really exists.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then Baldr, you’re also admitting that you are living under a fate of misfortune?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m begging you, stop saying that Brooks. Somehow I got the feeling that I’ll really fall into misfortune after you say that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s really not amusing that Baldr is going to walk a life that has even more drama than me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr poked and yelled at Teresa who was indignant and protesting for some reason.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You too, don’t talk like my misfortune is already set in stone!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This is a digression, but after this Franco and Teresa would become a couple that was famous throughout the continent with how in love they were with each other. They would be blessed with four sons and four daughters.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Each time Teresa got pregnant, she would recommend for Franco to take a concubine, but Franco would obstinately refuse. In the end, he never gave any glance at another woman for his whole life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hey? Hey? What do you think, I believe that the young lady of Count Alcanta will be to your liking……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No-! Teresa, look only at me, not another woman!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The sexual disposition of the king and queen was only known by a very small number of their close aides. Three hundred years later, a certain historian would publish this story under the name of “Reverse Spouse” and create a great boom of traps throughout the continent, but this was something that the two people in question had no way of knowing anything about.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aa……even though there are still many unknown beauties that are waiting for me in this kingdom……」(Teresa)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fufufufufu……that’s no good……I absolutely won’t let you meet with a girl who is prettier than me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Why didn’t their sexual disposition get exposed, even like this? Everything was wrapped in mystery──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 12
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr and others crossed Piller Massif that was the country border and stepped on the land of Mauricia once more. A group of horse carriages were approaching them with a cloud of dust rising behind them as though they had been waiting for the arrival of Baldr’s group.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seeing that the people were dressed in ordinary clothes and not carrying any weapons, they didn’t seem like the border guards but……depending on the situation they might be envoys from the king come to question them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr had the awareness that what he did at Sanjuan Kingdom had greatly exceeded the authority that was given to him, so he was breaking in cold sweat inside his heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oo~~~ii! Baldr-donooooo!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a charming baritone that he had heard before.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr unconsciously opened his eyes wide in surprise because this person should be in his territory instead of in this kind of place.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even the haughty Teresa got similarly flustered and stood up from her stirrup which was unusual for her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──F-father?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Viscount Mattis Bradford who should be at the western border──he was also a hero from the past war and a great man who many people hoped to take the post of a knight order commander and do great things with it. Such a person was charging this way with a terrifying expression. Even if they were thinking optimistically, this scene still wasn’t something good for their mental health.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Baldr who had gotten acquainted with an extreme stupid parent like Silk’s father Alford, the possibility of Mattis becoming enraged by Teresa and Franco’s engagement inevitably crossed his mind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「M-Mattis-sama……what happened this time is……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「BALDR-DONOOOO! I’M AMAZED! I’M AMAZED YOU MANAGED TO FIND A HUSBAND FOR THIS UNWORTHY DAUGHTERRRRR!!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yes?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Mattis hugged Baldr’s shoulders tightly with a wide smile that was full with unusually high tension. His hands were slapping Baldr’s back so hard that Baldr scowled from the pain.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed that Mattis wasn’t angry. Instead, he was thankful.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「To think that Teresa! That Teresa who doesn’t have even a shred of femininity in her! That Teresa who looks like she doesn’t have any womanly curve at all in her body! That Teresa who I thought was born as a woman by mistake! That Teresa has the crown prince of Sanjuan falling in love with her at the first sight and even has the honor to be adopted by our king as his adopted daughter! This Mattis swears that I will repay this debt to Baldr-dono even if I have to spend my whole life!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please calm down for now, Mattis-sama. Or rather, how can you say all those things about your own daughter.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Do you know how much trouble that daughter has caused for me? Do you know how much stomachaches I had from my wife pestering me about her? Baldr-dono, you are the savior of Bradford House!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The eyes of the nobles towards women who married late were harsh even at the best of times.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was only natural for Mattis’s wife to hurry her husband to find a house for their daughter to marry into.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa’s troubling sexual disposition made it even more troublesome.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Right now it still wasn’t that big of a problem, but if Teresa’s scandalous act became well-known in the future, it was possible that in the worst case it would become difficult for Mattis to search for a noble heir who would take her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wished that her daughter would be happy as a father, at the same time as the head of Bradford House, Mattis was also pressed with the need to find a noble house that would take Teresa as wife.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──It looks like I need to have a little bit of a talk with father. Especially about his perception toward his daughter as a father.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Mattis finally returned to his senses when he heard Teresa’s penetratingly cold tone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had forgotten himself from the happiness that an unresolved problem of many years had been solved, but thinking carefully, he had just spoken about his inner thoughts in front of his daughter too honestly. He only realized this too late.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「…………Well now, I was too happy that I don’t remember what was it that I had blurted out but, I wasn’t in my right mind at that time, so all of those things should be just ignored.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hou. Then I shall help my greatly forgetful father to recall it. First, I’ll use a shock therapy method!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Wait! No matter what, using a sword is just out of the question! H-help me Baldr-dono! I can’t go against my wife and daughter!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──No, you should go against them sometimes.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He felt like he had finally solved the mystery of Teresa’s self-centered attitude at this moment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s cold retort was ignored. The beating from Teresa who was emitting a silent anger to the surroundings was going to start.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「C-c-c-c-c-calm down. As someone who is going to marry a crown prince in the future, you should learn self-control first.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Of course I will refrain from any behavior that will bring shame to Franco. However, that will be after I teach father the correct way of how a father and daughter should be with each other.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Impossible-! Just what has Mylene been teaching you──!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Father, it’s not admirable for you to turn even mother into an enemy too you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oh god! Please save me-!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two started a father and daughter conversation using physical language. Baldr felt like he was witnessing a future scene between Franco and Teresa.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the end, did he really do a good thing by intermediating the relationship between Teresa and Franco?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was seriously troubled trying to judge the answer.
