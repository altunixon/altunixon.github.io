    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 1
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The mansion was in an uproar after Baldr was brought in with serious wounds, which looked atrocious just at a glance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     All of the available healers were summoned while Selina’s Savaran Company also went about procuring high class medicines for him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis could only stand there speechlessly with a shaking fist as he saw his son’s appearance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Fortunately, a kid’s healing capability was high. Baldr was recovering at a rapid pace.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, as the right arm was violently snapped until the point where the bone was jutting out and the left hand’s fingers were almost torn off, it needed about one month until they recovered even with the best treatment available.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun was nursing Baldr to the point that she even forgot to sleep.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Originally the head maid should order her to rest, but she took Seyruun’s feelings into consideration and allowed her to continue.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In fact, Seyruun couldn’t stop crying for more than half a day. Her mind might have become unbalanced if she wasn’t allowed to look after Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『──You won’t lay your hand on them, even if it costs me my life.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The image of Baldr’s back when he said that as he covered for Seyruun and Selina standing behind him was burnt into the back of her eyelids, and wouldn’t vanish even now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She thought that he was reliable.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She also felt happy as a woman.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──That was until Baldr was sent flying like a tattered and worn out rag.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The jutting white bone, the trickling blood, the trembling body……she felt a freezing chill in her back when she saw Baldr in such a state.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Baldr would be injured if he was slashed. He might die if he got into a fight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Seyruun noticed such an obvious thing, she immediately became scared that Baldr was fighting.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Don’t die.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Don’t die.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Next time, I’ll be the one to protect you.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It would be better that I died instead rather than having you injured in my stead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This feeling didn’t come solely because she was starting to be conscious of Baldr as a man that caught her eyes lately.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When she saw Baldr losing consciousness, for the first time she realized that everything in her life had been revolving around him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was why she couldn’t forgive herself, who had become a heavy burden for Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Anything was fine.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She wanted to become useful for Baldr, even if it was in only one thing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sey-nee, are you crying?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr finally opened his eyes on the third morning after the treatment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s kind gaze didn’t look any different from usual. Seyruun who was peering into those pretty marine blue eyes broke into a broad smile and leapt at Baldr’s neck.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Young master! Young master Baldr!!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ouch ouch……Sey-nee, it’s already. Everything’s already alright.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr caressed the hair of Seyruun who was crying a ‘waah-waah’ as she realized that he had survived that hopeless battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Using his head that was still hazy after waking up, Baldr recalled the memory of Sanai’s personality coming out and defeating Torus.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he had to make a comparison, what happened only felt like a memory that wasn’t accompanied by a sense of reality, like watching a TV broadcast.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     By feeling Seyruun’s soft limbs and body warmth, he finally caught on that he had returned alive from that deadly battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun must have reached the height of her fatigue. She immediately stopped crying and fell asleep while still hugging him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sleep well, Sey-nee.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr felt somewhat reluctant to separate from the feeling of Seyruun’s breasts, which had lately been growing considerably, as he put his hands around her waist in order to gently lay her slender body down on the bed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 2
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Meanwhile, at the suburban residence of the Cornelius House, Zirco and the other veteran mercenaries were huddling their big bodies together as they trembled like a bunch of scared puppies.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It has been a long time, eh, Zirco. No, should I call you Zirco the Gale now?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Do……don’t be so formal like that, big sis. Just call me Zirco like usual……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco couldn’t stop cold sweat from drenching her whole body even as she said that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even that arrogant Jamqa was keeping silent with a pale face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The killing intent that Maggot was giving off was too strong for anyone here to carelessly interrupt her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Not one of them could say a single joke.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Zirco and the other veteran warriors here were like green rookie soldiers before the aura that was covering Maggot. It gave off an intense and thick smell of death.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The Silver Light Maggot was a famous woman, a legend even while she was still alive.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Normally rumors tended to be the exaggeration of the truth, but in her case, the truth was in fact even more exaggerated than the rumor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Many men, including lower class nobles, tried to woo Maggot, who was also an incomparable beauty.  However, she declared that she wouldn’t go out with a man who was weaker than her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As a result, during the several years of war, Maggot received challenges from more than a hundred men.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The end result was obviously her staying undefeated.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There were also nobles who challenged her with ten people at the same time, but they were defeated handily without Maggot even breaking a sweat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That monster among monsters who was even said to rival a battalion by her lonesome could still scatter a thick bloodlust, one that made a person feel like they would be devoured even now.  It would be too much if one were to tell Zirco and the others to not be scared in this situation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco could feel it more than anyone. Even if all of them stood against Maggot together, they would be slaughtered in just a few seconds.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「And? Who is this man that made my son go through something like that?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「T-the chief said, they were the subordinates of Marquis Selvi.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fufufufu……looks like I’m being underestimated. Are they seriously trying to pick a fight with mee?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot chuckled with a very amused expression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But Zirco and others who were shown that fiendish smile couldn’t bear it at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They were assaulted with a misapprehension that if they spoke carelessly here, Maggot might go off to attack Marquis Selvi right away. Their backs unconsciously shivered.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The most terrifying thing was that they absolutely believed that Maggot might do exactly that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was a saying that “A smile is originally an aggressive expression”. Zirco never realized just how true that saying was until this day.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even an idiot son like that is someone who I have trained. For him to get beaten up that badly, the guy that was sent here must be really something.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yeah, the guy that the chief faced was really dangerous. If only he had ten more years to train, then perhaps he would have been able to give you a good fight.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hee……Zirco. You left Baldr to face that kind of man by himself. You were really taking it easy, weren’t you?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Geeh! I stepped on a landmine!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Zirco, you bitch! Don’t say anything unnecessary!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (W-we didn’t do anything wrongg–!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (You idiots! It’s times like this where we’re sharing our lot with one another!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco and co were shaking in their boots waiting for when Maggot was going to mention their responsibility of letting Baldr almost die. It felt like they were going to go crazy with fear.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She didn’t want to imagine it at all, but in case Maggot blamed Zirco’s ineptitude, she would have no way to oppose her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Before this, she thought that she might have closed the gap between her and Maggot a little after Maggot had retired from the mercenary business for ten years, but it seemed like the gap had widened even further instead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wasn’t like they had tried fighting for real, but Zirco wasn’t an amateur who couldn’t ascertain that much of a difference in strength.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「And, what’s your excuse?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Thaat’s……b-because, chief ordered us to hold back the other guys……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The best that all of you could do was only hold back the small fries? Perhaps it’ll be better if I retrain you guys from the start again.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please spare us. We’ll die!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot hadn’t been good at holding back since the past. There was an anecdote that when she was entrusted with training the new recruits, more than half of them were physically broken.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To say nothing of the day when Maggot needed someone to vent her anger on, even someone as skilled as Zirco seriously almost died.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You’re really fortunate, eh, Zirco……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In that instant, Maggot’s voice turned so low that it was almost freezing. Her voice changed to something like that of a fierce beast’s growl.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot’s deathly presence swelled up drastically in an instant, as though the air had thickened. Even now after ten years had passed, her aura that was once extolled as something akin to the death god of the battlefield was still going strong.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Survival is the mercenary’s number one priority. I don’t have anything to say about that. But, if Baldr had actually died there, I would twist your head off even if I would’ve had to chase you till the ends of the earth.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Haha……big sis, that joke isn’t funny you know……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was found out!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot found out that she was going to abandon Baldr and run away!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco’s facial muscles were convulsing. She felt sweat trickling out like a waterfall not only from her back, but also from her forehead and cheeks.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That just now wasn’t a joke. Maggot was someone who would really do it when she said she would do it. She also had more than enough strength to carry out her words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, she would only worsen her situation further if she honestly acknowledged it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (T-thank god! Thank god I didn’t run away!!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At that time when Baldr stood up, 99% of Zirco’s mind had been fixed towards running away.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was because she could only imagine their annihilation if Torus was heading their way.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no mercenary who would fight to the death if their employer had died.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco’s decision wasn’t mistaken as a mercenary, and Maggot herself also recognized that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But the responsibility of that decision being Baldr losing his life was a completely different matter from that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a terrifying prospect to even just imagine having her head targeted by a Maggot that had transformed into a revenge-filled demon.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That stupid son certainly needs to be punished but──you guys need punishment too as his underlings. Your contracts with him are still not rescinded, right?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When they heard Maggot’s words, the mercenaries who were all mature adults turned pale and raised their protests.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Wait a second! Our job is over already!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Rather, what do you mean punishment!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please let me go-! I have a wife waiting for me back home……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was also a man who made a dangerous confession (raising a death flag) amidst the panic, but Maggot only grinned fiercely and handed down her ultimatum arrogantly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Be thankful that you guys can still keep your life.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot was quietly but furiously raging because her beloved son was almost killed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If she didn’t vent out her stress somewhat, she would seriously go off alone to attack Selvi territory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From Maggot’s observation, with Zirco and the others’ capabilities, they would serve quite well for her stress relief, at least to a certain extent. They should be able to deal with it without losing their lives, at least.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Zirco and others who were pitifully assigned the role of sacrificial lamb cursed their own misfortune and prayed to god that they would be able to see the sun tomorrow.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 3
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What was waiting for Baldr when he was finally released from his bed was a call from his father Ignis.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Actually, he still hadn’t fully recovered, but in front of Seyruun who kept watching over him worriedly, he had to act strong and showed her that he was right as rain here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Young master Baldr, are you really alright? I wonder why the master is telling me that I can’t come along……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Because we need a talk between just the two of us, as parent and child, perhaps?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although there was no way that this call was for that kind of indulgent reason.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr became seized with a gloomy feeling when he imagined his father’s anger, but this was just him reaping what he sowed. He couldn’t run away from this, nor did he have any such intention.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll change your bandage as soon as you return, young master. Also, I’ll prepare a snack that I’ve been saving!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It felt like Seyruun had become even more overprotective than before since Baldr got injured.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He didn’t know whether she was joking or serious, but when she appeared last night with only a towel covering her body and asked him 「Should I wash your back?」, his lower body almost reacted.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps it was because of the maid moe that Masaharu’s memory imprinted into him…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     How should he interact with Seyruun from here on……Baldr felt anxious thinking about it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Excuse me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Baldr, huh. Enter.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis’s office was a boorish place that used a lot of oak wood to give it a solemn atmosphere. There were almost no decorations here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The mountain of paperwork that was arranged neatly on the desk was most likely the result of the sweat, tears, and blood of his excellent retainers instead of Ignis himself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis’s expression was too stiff and stern for a father who was welcoming his son who returned alive from the border of life and death.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr realized that his own prediction was correct.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was depressing, but he would be even more troubled if Ignis was so happy-go-lucky that he didn’t get angry at him here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Doga-!*
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s body was sent flying, along with a dull hitting sound.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He knew it was coming, but he couldn’t even follow the fist’s speed with his eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was punched while he was completely unguarded. He rolled on the office’s floor without stopping and crashed on the oak door that he had just entered before his body finally stopped.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Blood spurted out of his nose and several of his remaining baby teeth were broken. The inside of his mouth was wet with blood.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Do you understand why I hit you?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Yes.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had no intention of making excuses.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Everything was caused by his conceit.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If this was a battlefield, he wouldn’t be able to protest if he was beheaded for acting on his own.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Since when you have been suspecting an intervention from Selvi?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I believed that it didn’t take two months since the farm started operating at full-scale production before the information reached Marquis Selvi. After that, he started collecting information until he ran out of patience……at that point I believed that he would soon take action, without a doubt.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Why didn’t you report that to me?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「For giving the appearance that the farm is the project of a private business called the Savaran Company instead of the project of the Cornelius House. I thought that carelessly making this information known would only bring trouble. And then……I also thought my own strength would be enough to take care of it.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Yes, he arrogantly thought that there was no way he would lose to mere subordinates of Marquis Selvi.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was so embarrassed that he wanted to die from remembering his earlier self, which had fell into that feeling of omnipotence that chuunibyou often brought.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps black history was referring to this kind of thing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s quite the confidence. And, were Selvi’s dogs as weak as you thought?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No. One of them was a magnificent knight, who for the first time made me think there was someone other than mother that I couldn’t win against.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Seyruun and Selina weren’t there at that time, if he wasn’t resolved to protect them, it was extremely doubtful on whether Baldr (Sanai) would be able to stand up once more or not.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The wall that Baldr felt from the difference of skill between him and Torus was so high that it made him think like that with conviction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The likes of Maggot and Ramillies were far too strong for him, to the point where they couldn’t be an object of comparison.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In that light, perhaps Torus could be described as Baldr’s rival, who had given him his first taste of defeat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What would’ve happened if you were unable to defeat him?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Seyruun and Selina would be kidnapped, while the mercenaries would be annihilated.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Baldr stayed defeated at that time, Seyruun and Selina would undoubtedly have been kidnapped and brought to another country.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then after they had given all the information that they could, the possibility that they would be liberated was nonexistent.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The other side would have to hide the background and objective of the kidnappers. The two of them would be killed without any doubt.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr had exposed the lives of his important people to danger because of his arrogance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I heard that it was a coincidence the two of them were there. Originally, the target of the kidnapping should’ve been the children of our territory. If you had died, the innocent children would be the ones to die next.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s as you said.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He intentionally exposed his people to danger, even though he should be protecting them at all costs.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was the essence of the problem here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr knew very well just how much Ignis treasured his people. It made him gnash his teeth even harder at his own foolishness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had properly trained the children on how to evacuate.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The children didn’t hold any valuable information anyway.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     With Zirco and the other mercenaries there, it wouldn’t be that hard to suppress the enemies.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because Baldr had such optimistic thinking, he didn’t seriously consider how he was exposing the children’s lives to danger.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「We nobles exist in order to protect the nation and the people. We must never expose the people to danger for our own convenience. You were lacking such pride and resolve.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr nodded wordlessly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It might be easy to get the wrong idea because there was the memory of Sanai and Masaharu inside Baldr, but the essential part of Baldr’s mind was still that of a twelve year old boy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though he worked out a political scheme that was unbelievable coming from a child and boasted a martial skill that would make adults lose face, it was nothing more than a surface appearance that wasn’t accompanied by the resolve to bear the responsibility and the experience of entering a battle of life and death.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That fact was exposed from the attack this time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Perhaps you’re thinking that I’m an unreliable father……even so, you’re still a child. At the very least, I won’t mistake the gravity of what I should protect, unlike you.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis too was aware that he was third rate as a politician and as a territorial ruler.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He also understood that the reason why Baldr hesitated to report to him was because he was taking that into consideration.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all, he didn’t even know that his territory was producing sugar until the few noble friends that he was interacting with asked him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had the self-confidence that he would protect the people even if it cost him his life, but Baldr was more capable than him in regards to enriching the people’s life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However the act of using the people’s lives as a betting chip in exchange for those riches was violating Ignis’s taboo as a noble.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because they were honorable nobles of Mauricia Kingdom, there was a line that they mustn’t cross no matter what. There was a pride that they had to protect no matter what. That was what Ignis believed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Actually, the number of nobles who didn’t have such a belief might be the majority, but Ignis didn’t give a damn about such things.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the very least, the members of Cornelius House that rose to their position as a military family had to be like that. The head of the house mustn’t forget that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because of the case this time, Ignis recalled where he learned his pride and cultivated his conviction as a noble.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Someone who lacks resolve can’t serve as a lord even if they have the talent. Baldr, originally this should be for when you’re fourteen, but go enroll into the royal knight academy next month.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The royal knight academy was just like its name suggested. It was a government school for training knights.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis also spent his juvenile years from when he was fourteen till eighteen years old there.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He knew a woman for the first time and learned how to play in the red-light district also around that time. Though of course, this was a secret from Maggot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Originally, someone should be fourteen to enter this academy. The exception of enrolling there as a twelve year old was accepted by that General Ramillies.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies was finally freed from his duty after ten years passed since the end of the war. Starting from last year he was appointed as the headmaster of the royal knight academy while still keeping his rank as a general.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies welcomed Baldr’s slightly early enrollment wholeheartedly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I have two matters that I wish to request.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Let’s hear them.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It was my blunder that exposed the children in the farm to danger, but that place is a precious workplace for them to earn wages. Please continue the farm and safeguard it so they can still have a place to work.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter the era, child labor was always cheap and wasn’t really worth it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s farm where there was light work that even children could do and could earn decent pay was also a precious source of income for the children’s parents.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In addition, the farm was also a part of Savaran Company’s income source. A part of the profit there would also be circulated inside the Cornelius territory as a tax.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The negative effect of this farm being abolished here would be too great.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「We still have enough spare soldiers. I promise that I won’t let Selvi’s men try anything with it.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Thank you very much. Second, there will be nobles who try interfering with Savaran Company in the future. However, that company is indispensable for the development of the Cornelius territory. Please don’t allow any other house to interfere, no matter what.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Savaran Company right now was a tree that was growing money.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There might be invitations like 「I’ll give you preferential treatment, so how about moving to my territory?」 or threats like 「If you don’t tell me the way to create sugar, I’ll use my authority as noble to charge you with a  crime」 to the company.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was unthinkable that Selina would betray Baldr, no matter how good the offer, but there was a high possibility that a noble who envied the Cornelius territory’s prosperity would try something malicious.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The company of that Selina girl, huh? I’m also in her debt for procuring valuable medicine for your treatment. I swear I’ll help her as long as it’s within my capability.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was these straightforward decisions and genuine sincerity that was the virtue of Ignis which he ought to be proud about.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the same time they were also his flaws, but it wouldn’t matter if Baldr compensated for that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If it was another feudal lord who was in Ignis’s position, there was a possibility they would get the secret from the Savaran Company and monopolize it for their own profit.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Did Ignis understand just how great a source of wealth this could become?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Most likely he didn’t understand it, but even if he actually understood, Ignis’s answer would still be the same. Baldr didn’t doubt that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then one last thing──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis’s face changed completely from the stern face of a lord into a smiling face. He crouched down and caressed Baldr’s silver hair roughly before hugging him with all his strength.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The hug of his father after so long was rugged and hard, unlike Maggot, but it was filled with a reliable sense of security that couldn’t be compared to anything.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Thank god you survived. You had me worried!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Tou-san!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was like a dam broke and tears flooded out one after another. Baldr cried while a part of his mind felt like what was going on was happening to somebody else.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His father’s forgiveness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     How he was actually feeling absurdly terrified from almost dying.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     How he couldn’t sleep at night when thinking, ‘what if Selina and Seyruun died from what happened?’
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Those thoughts became jumbled and tangled with one another and he couldn’t stop his emotions from overflowing out of his heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr cried loudly, like there was something broken inside of him. This time for sure, he accepted from the bottom of his heart that he was nothing more than a twelve year old brat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 4
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     With his enrollment into the knight academy decided, Baldr who was sorting out his room folded his arms and groaned.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It could be said that he was in agony.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the end, was it alright for him to entrust himself to this impulse that was rising from inside of him?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He worked his brain for a long time, thinking hard of what he would obtain and what he would lose by doing this. Even so, the answer wouldn’t form at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Gold coins were piled up like a mountain in front of Baldr’s eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The profit from the gold plated works and sugar shipment had been paid to him in proportion to the amount of money he invested, excluding the twenty percent for the intermediation fee.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In addition the recipe fee for mayonnaise, the sales fee of Othello, and fees from some other things were also growing smoothly. Before he realized it, there was already a great amount of gold coins piling up in Baldr’s possession.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Yes, gold coins! Gold coins!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The dazzling radiance of gold that was throwing the rational mind into chaos was now in front of his eyes!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This moment had finally come. No wait, wait, please wait I’m begging you!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The three personalities that were fused inside Baldr were thinking things that ran counter to one another.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr who had been raised as a noble, Masaharu who possessed the good sense of a modern person, the two of them harbored a feeling of avoidance toward this kind of temptation that was hard to be erased.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the enormous desire of Sanai who had become an equal existence within them greatly surpassed such a feeling of avoidance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was swallowed by an impulse that was difficult to resist. He was unconsciously forming words in order to convince himself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「T-this is the form of my gratitude toward Sanai-dono……! The proof of my gratitude toward Sanai-dono, who is my life’s savior-! Its my overwhelming gratitude!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr finally resolved himself and started lining up the gold coins on the floor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because the gold coins weren’t flattened like koban (small oval gold coins used in the Edo period), the surface area a single coin could cover was small, but it didn’t matter whether it was koban or gold coins. The profoundly mysterious aura that could only be emitted by gold didn’t change at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s eyes quickly became enchanted by that dazzling radiance. His expression turned ecstatic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This radiance……this pure radiance is driving me mad!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was lining up the coins one by one. A grin of pleasure was forming on his mouth. Soon he might even start drooling.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The number of gold coins that he saved up was actually more than a thousand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was an extraordinary amount when taking into consideration how it had only been half a year since Baldr started earning money.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the amount was still insufficient to completely cover the whole floor’s surface.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had to earn even more and more money in order to completely cover the room with gold coins too……that was Baldr’s thought.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It would surely be a magnificent view if a room that was the size of his father’s office was filled with gold coins all over.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But he couldn’t ask for something that didn’t exist, so Baldr spread out the gold coins with some distance between them. With that he was somehow able to cover about three tatami’s worth.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (──Should I?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As expected, Baldr’s rational mind was hesitating with the gold coins spread out in front of him. However, his emotions were surging with excitement. He was even feeling an impatience that made him want to yell even now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His throat felt parched. Baldr was instinctually aware that in order to cure this thirst, he could only carry it out.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr suddenly took off his clothes and threw them away.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His healthily tanned skin and his limbs that still had scars that looked like welts on them even after healing were laid bare.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Only half a year was left till he became thirteen. The muscles that were starting to fill his body little by little and the skin that was still leaving behind childish softness had the beauty that might make someone with a taste for little boys get a nosebleed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course, Baldr himself wasn’t really narcissistic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What he had was only an abnormal obsession and an affection towards money.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I   CAN FLYYYYY!!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr leapt towards the sea of gold coins with a smile on his face, as bare as the day he was born.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr spread out his hands as though to embrace the gold coins that were approaching before his eyes and his whole body touched the floor──.
    </span>

   <p>

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the villa of the Oka Clan, the retainer of Gamou Clan. It was a custom for a secret event to be carried out there every month. Right now that event was underway with great enthusiasm.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If only our lord doesn’t have this kind of habit……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Indeed……well, the lord wouldn’t be the lord if he weren’t this interested in money.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s not like it’s a bad thing to love money. But this is……overdoing it, isn’t it?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two samurais smiled wryly while nodding at each other.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Their lord, Oka Sanai would blanket the floor of his room with koban once a month. Then he would roll around on them naked. Before he knew it the rumor of such a strange habit had spread, forcing the retainers of Oka Clan to feel extremely ashamed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uhihihi……unbearable-! This is unbearableeeeeeee!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai’s figure that was rolling from corner to corner inside the room and bumped on the wall before reversing direction stark naked could only be said as perverse, even in this era filled with so many eccentrics.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Shockingly, this strange habit would continue without fail until Sanai had become completely bedridden.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Oka Sanai Sadatoshi──he was a man who had never wavered to the bitter end (this was a true historical fact).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uhoooh! It came! It came! IT CAMEEEEE!!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In battle, he was a general with peerless courage and overflowing with ingenuity. Even in the time of peace he governed the people well. He wouldn’t be negligent in making preparations for the critical moment. He was a lord that his retainers were proud of and respected from the bottom of their heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Except for this habit.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Can’t he……restrain himself a bit more?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This habit would have been cured a long time ago if the lord could do that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The pitiful retainers looked at each other’s face and let out a long sigh while deciding to treat this as if nothing were going on.

    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 6
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was feeling the texture of gold coins on his back, chest, cheeks, fingers, everywhere. An eerie laugh that was unbefitting a child’s leaked out of his mouth.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fuhehehehehehehehehehehehe」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     How fun! How can there be something this wonderfully moving in this world! The seductive sensation of gold on the bare skin felt sensual, even.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Kuh……if only there were more of them, I’d be able to taste the gold even more.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Roll roll roll roll roll-*
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was rolling around in every direction inside the room. There was a feeling of nostalgia, even though this was his first time doing this since he was born. He was getting absorbed into the act.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It didn’t feel like he would get tired of this, no matter how long he was doing it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The fragrant scent of gold, the warmth of gold that could only be felt with his bare skin.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The cover that this was his show of gratitude toward Sanai had gone flying somewhere unknown.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr swore deep inside his heart that he had to save up more and more money so that he could taste this supreme bliss once more.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Coincidentally around that time, Seyruun had been told about Baldr’s enrollment in the royal knight academy from Ignis personally. Now she was staring at empty air with an expression that was lacking in vigor, as though she had forgotten to put on her smiling face, along with its charming dimple.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Young master Baldr will be gone from my side……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Who should she devote herself to take care of if that happened?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though Seyruun’s everything was dedicated to Baldr from the time she woke up in the morning until she went to sleep at night.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was fine even if she was unable to do anything, she wanted to go to the royal capital to accompany Baldr. She tried making a direct appeal for that, and yet the royal knight academy was a semi-military establishment. Living together with other students in the dormitory was also a part of the training there.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Naturally there were also noble children among the students, but as expected it seemed they weren’t allowed to be accompanied by servants.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uu……hics……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The sadness of being torn away from Baldr’s side caused large teardrops to spill out of Seyruun’s eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since that tragic day, Seyruun felt like she had returned to the days when she was still a little crybaby.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To think that she was this dependent on Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uuh, young master……young master Baldr!!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since it had come to this, there was no other choice than asking Baldr himself to take her along.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if Baldr had to live in a dormitory over there, there was no way he would be satisfied with just studying in the academy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His business dealing with Selina would still continue. It would be more convenient for Baldr if he had someone to take the role as his messenger in the capital.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If push came to shove, she wouldn’t mind even if she had to work in the dormitory as a maid and do the menial chores there.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      That’s right! That’s a good idea!
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun thought that it was a really good idea and broke into a small run towards Baldr’s room. She couldn’t push down her eager feeling and put her hand on the door without even knocking.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then the door of destiny was opened wide to show something that should be absolutely impossible……normally.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Young master! Please listen to……my request…………for?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>

    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Click*
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Behind the opened door, Baldr could be seen. Stark naked. Frolicking in gold coins, not a thing covering his body.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Young……master……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sey……nee……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The saying of “It felt like time had stopped” must exist for this kind of situation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Some more time was needed until their brains were able to comprehend just how significant the situation that they had encountered right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「………………」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「………………」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What burst the extremely awkward silence that felt like it would continue for eternity were the yells that broke out five seconds later.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun screamed as though she had been released from a binding curse. Baldr hurriedly hid his crotch and pulled the clothes that he had thrown around haphazardly toward himself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hawawawa……young master Baldr’s p○n○s is, his p○n○s is……growing big and going buwoooh……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t say it Sey-nee! I’;m begging you don’t say anything further than thatttttt!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even the sorrowful scream of Baldr’s soul couldn’t reach Seyruun.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun’s head was rocking back and forth like a broken doll. She continued muttering with eyes that were lacking focus.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Buwoooh……Young master buwoooh……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Seyruun who had just entered puberty, Baldr’s lethal weapon that had grown further than she imagined when she still thought of him as a kid was too strong of a stimulation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I-it’s over……time……if only I can turn back the timeeeee!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A girl who he was just starting to feel conscious toward had witnessed his shameful appearance, one that shouldn’t be exposed to anyone. The mental damage from that wasn’t something ordinary.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was writhing violently like a former chuuni patient who had his black history exposed, wanting to die rather than living on in shame.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was only thirty minutes later when the head maid finally discovered Baldr who was tearing off his head with an expression of despair and Seyruun who was still continuing to mutter 「Buwoooh, buwoooh」 .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even when she tried to ask what happened, the two of them stayed silent and didn’t say anything.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then for some reason Baldr wouldn’t take a single step out of his room until the day before his departure to the knight academy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This incident left behind a deep wound in Baldr’s heart that he buried as deeply as he could.
    </span>

     Perhaps Sanai had whispered that or perhaps not, nobody knew for certain.

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 7
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis and Maggot of Cornelius House were widely acknowledged as a loving couple.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two of them were joined together in marriage together with a dramatic process that was called the “Cornelius Couple’s Hunting” by the world at large, but it was heavily rumored that in their everyday life the husband Ignis was completely whipped by his wife Maggot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, there was no doubting their love for each other. The retainers of Cornelius House were also relieved that Ignis who had a bit of bad habit in womanizing had finally settled down.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But Ignis was raised as the eldest son of a count and received education as a knight at the royal capital, while Maggot was a former mercenary. It was only natural that a lot of the time they would have different opinions from one another.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In most cases, Maggot would carefully consider Ignis’s dignity as a noble and hold back (though the stress reduction because of that was mostly directed toward Baldr), but there were also some problems that she wouldn’t yield on.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Especially in regards to the case that happened the other day. The opinions of the two were in direct opposition against each other and it engraved a deep mark into the relationship between the married couple of Cornelius House.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──I heard that you punched Baldr before this?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot’s gaze was cold like a sharp blade.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis noticed that she was taking a great offense to this matter, even so there was no way he could draw back here as the head of the house. He replied back resolutely.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The blunder that Baldr committed this time cannot be forgiven without any punishment. Baldr himself also understood that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hah」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggos scoffed at Ignis’s reply.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Just what had he done that constituted this as a blunder? He protected the women, defended the farm, and turned the tables on all the enemies without leaving any alive. That’s a great military result that should be rewarded instead!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……That’s if you consider only the result.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s results that are more important than anything else. An ideal that isn’t accompanied by results is nothing but dog food. Acting arbitrarily will result in beheading if it results in failure, but it’ll be a distinguished service instead if it succeeds. I won’t let you say that you never acted arbitrarily in the battlefield, Ignis.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot, who was originally a mercenary, was a complete realist.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course she would make sure anyone to take responsibility for the result that they brought about themselves, but the result that Baldr produced this time was the best result instead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot was greatly enraged that the son she extremely cherished almost lost his life, but in regards to the actions that Baldr took, she believed there wasn’t really anything that could be criticized about it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He staked his life to protect Seyruun and magnificently took down a formidable enemy who was stronger than himself. Rather her true feelings were that she wished to heap a ton of praises upon Baldr while saying, ‘as expected of my son’.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That boy is still not in the position nor the age to shoulder the responsibility of what he had done. What happened has gone outside of what Baldr can shoulder.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Despite predicting that there was a definite possibility of infiltrators coming from a hostile country, Baldr planned to repel them by himself and because of that he permitted ordinary people to be exposed into danger──Ignis had no intention of granting such authority to his son whether now in the present, or in the future.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was something that Ignis wouldn’t yield on as a feudal lord.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But Maggot also wouldn’t yield.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「We couldn’t possibly dispatch this territory’s soldiers to that farm at that point in time. In order to maintain the secrecy of the precious sugar, dealing with the infiltrators discretely was the best method. We would be suspected of involvement in the sugar production if we carelessly took action. You had also been questioned many times about the sugar at the high society events, haven’t you?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yeah, but it’s not like it matters who produced the sugar. It’s just sugar──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Gasun-!*
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
<img src="img/265.jpg"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A thick vein was pulsing on Maggot’s forehead. She had just thrown a knife that grazed Ignis’s right cheek.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The knife was buried into the wall up until its hilt. Ignis could only stare at it with a pale face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Has your brain turned into muscles too? Sugar can only be produced in the south, where sugarcane can grow. In the first place, it’s impossible for sugar to be produced in this area where sugarcane cannot grow.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Th-then how does the sugar get produced here?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s why, the whole country is desperately investigating in order to learn that right now! Selvi’s guys also came here to ascertain that!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then, it’s even more pressing for us to send soldiers to guard the place……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You brain dead dolt! You still don’t get it! The secrecy is more to hold back the nobles within Mauricia itself rather than against the likes of Selvi!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Cornelius House dispatched soldiers to guard the sugar production area, they wouldn’t be able to claim that they didn’t know anything any longer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Until now they could insist 「It’s a company in my territory that does it but I myself don’t really get it (in fact they really didn’t know about it)」 towards the other nobles, but when that claim didn’t work anymore, even Maggot had to admit that it would be nearly impossible for Ignis to protect the secret.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Or rather, this man had the tendency to quickly lower his guard when he was interacting with an allied army.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was a reliable man when fighting together in the battlefield, but he didn’t understand that in times of peace the most troublesome enemy was one’s own ally instead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even the economic advantage that they fortunately obtained would be quickly lost if it were spread to the whole country.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In regards to this problem, even friendly nobles were still their rivals. Sophisticated political and economic sense would be necessary if one wanted to maintain a cooperative relationship in this kind of matter.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis still didn’t look fully convinced, so Maggot sighed and argued vehemently.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Imagine that there’s a blacksmith who can forge a sword at the level of a national treasure. Naturally that blacksmith won’t just teach his technique to anyone who asks without a care. After all, who knows if it’ll get misused for a malicious deed somewhere. The family of that blacksmith will mostly teach the technique to just their descendants without allowing it to leak out to outsiders. This sugar production technique is the same. If you considered the immense effort and investment that they must have spent to discover the technique, it’s out of question to ask them to teach the method for free. It’s even rude to ask them to do so, don’t you think so?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I see, I understand if it’s like that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Because of that, you should leave that farm to me. Luckily, I also have connections, I’m not going to let anything bad happen to it.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This connection was naturally referring to Zirco and the others.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wouldn’t be desirable for Cornelius House to manage the farm openly. Using mercenaries to guard the farm should be the better solution.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course, it would be necessary to increase their number. Selina had already offered to aid in that endeavor with her funds.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──That’s why」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Actually, everything so far had been nothing more than the preface. The important topic for Maggot started here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Usually, she wouldn’t oppose Ignis’s decision openly, but sometimes there would also be things that she absolutely couldn’t tolerate.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Baldr hasn’t done anything wrong. Because of that, we should cancel his enrollment into the royal knight academy.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Haa??」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis blinked with a gaze that was asking,
    </span>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      What is this woman saying?
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was taken aback by the suggestion that came out of nowhere.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Because it’s true, isn’t it? You’re sending Baldr to the knight academy in order to reeducate him, right? But if Baldr actually hasn’t done anything wrong, that means there isn’t any need for that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In short this Maggot was reluctant, really really reluctant to part from her treasured toy……or rather, her treasured son.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There’s no way I can do something like that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Why!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This time their position was reversed. Ignis was the one who started pointing out Maggot’s thoughtlessness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the end, although they had areas where they were good at and not good at, they were husband and wife who were similar with each other at the principle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This matter has been approved by the headmaster of the royal knight academy, General Ramillies, and also by his majesty the king. This isn’t a decision that we can change as we please by our own convenience. Besides, Baldr won’t just learn about being a knight at the knight academy. He will form connections and make friends there too. It won’t be useless at all for his future.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis recalled the days that he spent at the royal capital in his juvenile years.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The daily life of diligent studying and training with close friends of the same age and different social status. The fun times when they headed downtown together during holidays and made merry. All those memories were important treasures for Ignis.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then, his experience with his first woman──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Just now, you were thinking of other women, weren’t you?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ueh?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was bad that he subconsciously recalled the woman who he first went out with.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot who sniffed the scent of a past woman from Ignis swiftly transformed into the cruel goddess who ruled over the battlefield, the “Silver Light”.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I see……I can’t believe it, you’re trying to send my adorable Baldr to your memorable place where you discarded your virginity, aren’t you?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「N-n-n-n-n-n, no-, there’s no way I’m trying something like that isn’t it? I-I’m begging you, calm down first, Maggot……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fufufufufufufufufufu……it has been so long since I was made to feel this displeased. How about it? Let’s enjoy ourselves with a battle dance together after so long.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Wait! It’s just a mistake of the past, it should be invalid at this point!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot once had forgiven Ignis for his various experiences with women that were far too many, but the problem this time was different.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「A punishment is needed for the idiot who is trying to dirty my Baldr!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Some time later, although Ignis was left battered on the floor, he didn’t shame his nickname of Ignis the Iron Wall and just barely managed to protect his life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In addition, he also didn’t back down against Maggot’s fervent persuasion (threat) with her body language and succeeded in forcing Baldr’s enrollment to continue.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although the compensation that he paid for that was nothing short of immense. For a while after that, Ignis’s pitiful figure wrapped in blankets could be seen at his office after being kicked out of the master bedroom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Also, when the next day came, Maggot whose sense of danger had been greatly fanned up called for Seyruun, who had been serving at Baldr’s side since she was little, and gave her a new duty in order to protect Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll go! I’ll absolutely go together with the young master no matter what!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    「I’m counting on you, Seyruun. I’ll talk to Ramillies-
    <ruby>
     jiisama
     <rt>
      grandfather
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    to get him to accept it. No matter what, you mustn’t let any harmful insect get near Baldr!」
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Please leave it to me, madam!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two of them exchanged a firm handshake. Ignis imagined the hardship that Baldr would go through in the future.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all, from Ignis’s eyes, this scene only looked like a mother-in-law and a wife worrying about their son (husband).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Well, he didn’t mind about Seyruun becoming Baldr’s wife in itself, or rather it was within his assumptions.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    「Call for me right away if there is something that’s beyond your capacities. Never be reserved or hesitate, even by mistake! Men around his age will easily get their virginity devoured, after all, just like my
    <ruby>
     stupid husband
     <rt>
      lady killer
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    !」
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course. I will never let any other woman approach young master’s ‘buwoooh’!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Buwoooh?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「N-no no. This Seyruun swear to protect young master’s virtue even if it costs me my life!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (My pitiful son. In this case, it might be better if you quickly seduce Seyruun to turn her into your ally so you can live a fun academy life. Relationships with women are something very precious for a man’s springtime of youth.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot sent a sharp gaze towards Ignis who was having such thoughts.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──Do you want to dance with me again?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Seyruun, watch over my son carefully over there.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I’m sorry, my son. Father doesn’t want to die!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis, who was reputed as a philanderer in the past, was driven with the temptation of teaching his son how to play with fire. But he wasn’t so driven that he would expose his life in danger.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 8
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The time of the departure finally arrived.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr boarded the horse carriage and bowed deeply towards Ignis and Maggot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then I’ll be going, Tou-san, Kaa-san.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun secured the seat beside Baldr like it was only natural. She was making a bright smile from achieving her objective in accompanying Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Either way, she was able to take a lead against her rival Selina with this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina had been absent from Cornelius since the other day because of a business negotiation. She didn’t know about Baldr’s departure today.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although this was that Selina they were talking about. When she learned about this, she would surely chase Baldr until the capital immediately.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Study well over there.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I wish to rediscover myself once more……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Recently, Baldr tended to abase himself with an empty gaze.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis was worried that he had scolded him too hard the other day.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all, Baldr even said something like 「I’m sorry for being born」 and the like the other day.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However Baldr was still young. Surely he would get back on his feet and have even greater success in the future.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Kaa-san, thank you for everything until now. I’ll go and see how far the martial skill that Kaa-san has taught me until now will fare in the greater world.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph……I’ll work you hard again if you get tired of the training at the capital (You can come home anytime you like, you know?)」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll be diligent so that won’t happen.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ku-ku-ku……well, be careful so that you don’t slack too much in the capital, or else I’ll visit to beat you up personally back into shape (Mama will be the one who goes there if you leave mama alone for too long!)」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The coach turned toward Ignis and bowed his head before raising the reins, then the simple carriage that was pulled by two horses finally departed to the capital.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr leaned out from his seat and waved his hand towards his family, the servants, and the children including Tyros who came to see him off.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Everyone! Thank you for everything until now! I’m going!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please take care of yourself, Baldr-sama!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Baldr-sama! Thank you for all the delicious foods!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「We’ll also do our best here!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Both Ignis and Maggot continued to wave until the horse carriage was gone from view.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then at the same time when the horse carriage had vanished, Maggot hugged Ignis’s chest and let out a sob, with her face buried in his chest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uuu……Baldr……Baldrrr……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis gently hugged Maggot who continued crying like a child. He whispered gently into her ear.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You endured well. You’re a great mother.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fueee……mama is lonelyyyy……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wondered why she was unable to say those words directly to Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot Cornelius──even though she easily got lonely, she was an awkward woman who couldn’t be honest in front of her son no matter what.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The servants of Cornelius House and Zirco who also personally came to see off Baldr froze like a stone at Maggot’s pathetic appearance that they couldn’t imagine at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It went without saying that the shock cleanly erased this memory from their brain, as though it never happened, in order to protect themselves.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 9
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the Selvi territory that was at the other side of the national border from Cornelius territory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Inside the territory that paid the most sacrifices due to its role as the base for invasion against Mauricia, the gloomy atmosphere still couldn’t be wiped away even now, after ten years had passed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The shortage of population to work in the farms and industries and the expansion of the military that reduced the number even more forced a heavy burden on the people. Their situation was so horrible that even travelers could see it just from a glance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Just the other day, a certain group of merchants visited the castle town of Selvi territory that was in such a state.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The merchants had stopped by at the Cornelius territory for the sake of peddling their wares. During that time Ignis requested them to deliver something to Marquis Selvi for him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……The count said that he is returning 『the remains of the nameless heroes』.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis had processed the corpses of the knights so they wouldn’t rot and sent them back home.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Something like this wasn’t that unusual to be done on the battlefield.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Confirmation of soldiers’ lives or death was nearly the biggest priority when dealing with the aftermath of battles. Sometimes the two armies that were fighting would even work together for that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis followed his experience in the past and thought that he had to return the corpses of the enemy soldiers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Andrei’s aide Dorun, who learned of Ignis’s doing showed a completely unapproachable reaction. It greatly troubled the merchants.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How dare he send these corpses that are completely unrelated to our house. This is a great insult. That mountain monkey of Mauricia has even forgotten the etiquette as a noble!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Far from giving thanks, Dorun showed an intense anger instead. The merchants who never expected this reaction desperately bowed their heads without understanding what was actually going on.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then it looked like they who were only asked to transport the bodies here were going to be executed too, so they scrambled to leave Marquis Selvi’s house in panic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The merchants could finally calm down after they returned to their inn at the castle town. They couldn’t help but resent Ignis who caused them to meet such a dangerous experience.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, they were people with high professionalism that couldn’t leave a job undone when they were already paid, so they didn’t just stop there.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They brought the corpses that Dorun refused to receive and buried them in a cemetery for those who left no relatives behind in the Selvi territory. They paid the funeral cost and held a simple funeral service for the corpses.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They only did the minimum requirement, but it could be said as fortunate for the corpses, because they could have a priest from the church hold a service for them, unlike those unidentified people who died by the roadside.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Dorun received the report from his subordinates about everything that happened from start to finish. He let out a deep sigh that was accompanied with rage and hatred that was seething like magma. He couldn’t suppress this feeling.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since the contact from Torus and his men ceased coming, he had resolved himself that their prospect of still being alive was nonexistent.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, he couldn’t hide his shock as expected when the reality was shown right before him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Somewhere in his heart Dorun was unable to accept that someone as strong as Torus could fail in his mission.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Torus, who in the world your opponent was? Who defeated you?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     According to the report, the wound that killed Torus came from a single sword thrust into the throat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if he tried to search within Selvi territory, he wouldn’t be able to find any swordsman who could kill that Torus not with a spear, but by a single attack of a sword.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If there was someone with such skill other than Ignis and Maggot on the enemy’s side, they would be a grave threat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The unknown swordsman, the development of Cornelius territory that was still wrapped in mystery──Torus who had grasped a part of that mystery could no longer speak.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When he thought of the mortification that Torus must have felt, Dorun couldn’t bring himself to criticize Torus’s failure.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No, there was no way he could possibly do something like that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had already made a false report which said that Torus and his men who were in the infiltration squad had fallen into Midas River in the middle of training. The fierce river’s flow and the increase in water from the rain were blamed for their death.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Therefore, Dorun wasn’t permitted to bury or even mourn his subordinates who lost their lives in foreign land for the sake of this house. He couldn’t even ascertain their faces in death and burned them into his memory──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「He really gets on my nerves! That cursed hypocrite who is only good in battle!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis must have only followed the custom on the battlefield and sent the corpses back without any ulterior motive.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He didn’t even consider the political problems that his action would cause.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Selvi House accepted the corpses of Torus and his men, it would be the same as admitting that they had violated the peace treaty by sending hostile soldiers to Cornelius territory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was why Dorun couldn’t recognize the corpses as Torus and his men no matter what. He couldn’t even think of mourning for them in the future.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Not only had capable and loyal youths lost their lives, he had to stand still watching their bodies buried as complete strangers even though their location was just a stone’s throw away. This humiliation and mortification had surpassed the limit that could be expressed with words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then, while he could only watch and grit his teeth like this, Ignis would believe that he had done something good without understanding anything. It made Dorun want to vomit.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Someone who had lost their comrades, family, or lover in an extreme situation like war and could still pay respect and moderation toward their enemies had the qualities of a hero.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He didn’t want to admit it but Ignis was a man with such a heroic qualification.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, such pure earnestness was nothing but a nuisance in times of peace.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the very least, Dorun believed that any responsible noble would surely have done something shady for the sake of their house and their people.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In actuality, Ignis’s act that was adhering to etiquette with such naïve honesty had brought a serious impact on the Selvi House.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──What are they doing?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Dorun questioned his subordinate.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「They’re suspecting us, as expected. Lately they keep a close watch on the graves.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「As I thought……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The faction that supported the continuation of war wasn’t in the majority in the Haurelia Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although the royal family were supporting the idea of going back into war one day, there were many nobles who wanted to wash their hands of a war that only brought great harm to them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The person with the largest influence in the opposing faction is the cousin of the king, the duke Jean Montfort(ジャン-モンフォール).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Jean had great skill as a feudal lord. He independently developed his territory with that business acumen. War that would turn that profit into nothing was simply a nightmare for him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The nobles who were his subordinates shared in the leftovers of that economical benefit. They formed a faction that proactively insisted they should tie a friendly relationship with Mauricia Kingdom immediately.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That Jean got suspicious why the Silver Light Maggot was frequently patrolling the border. He was sending a lot of spies into the Selvi territory to investigate it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The arrival of the corpses was at the worst timing, when the investigation of those spies had become active.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If this matter were to be discovered, Selvi House itself could be crushed if they were unlucky.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Right now they couldn’t even be seen making the slightest movement towards Cornelius.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was why Dorun could only coldly reject the corpses of Torus and his men.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The irritating thing here was how this wasn’t something that Ignis calculated.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That man was simply wishing to pay his respects toward Torus’s valor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no way that he had spared any thought of what Torus himself wished for or how Dorun would feel when the corpses were shown to him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And yet look at the result.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was them, Selvi House that got cornered, while Ignis himself was undoubtedly immersed in relief and self-satisfaction right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It felt like they had been reduced down to something dirty. Dorun shook his head in anger.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They weren’t mistaken.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     None of what they did was a mistake.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For the sake of the house, for the sake of the country, for the sake of the family, for the sake of the retainers, scheming to drag the opponent down was a necessary evil. Those without power in the end would fall into a malicious trap.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That should be the true reality of the noble society and the strife between countries.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      This is why I hate you who continue to impudently believe in your naïve ideal!

      .
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     With frustration that made them want to vomit blood, both Dorun and also Andrei pulled back from Cornelius and abandoned Torus’s corpse.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The spies of Duke Montfort couldn’t obtain any significant results and reported like this to their lord.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Although Selvi House is eager to fight, there is no sign of them running wild for the moment. It seems the Silver Light’s patrol is a measure toward some bandits that infested the border. The bandits seemed to be a mercenary group that targeted Cornelius territory due to their booming business conditions lately. A part of that bandit group was buried in the cemetery for those with no relatives. At the present time, we can’t find any proof that there’s a relationship between the mercenaries and Selvi House.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if Selvi House was a prominent family, they couldn’t change the policy of the whole country.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A decisive change between the two countries would be necessary in order to start the hostilities once more.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Dorun chose to remain in obscurity quietly until that chance arrived.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However he had no intention of just waiting uselessly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all, if a change was necessary, then all he needed to do was create one.
