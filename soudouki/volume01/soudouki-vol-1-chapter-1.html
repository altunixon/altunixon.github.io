   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Here, the pocket money for this month. Don’t waste it on useless things, okay?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Tou-sama! Thank you!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr held out both his hands with a childishly energetic voice and accepted a silver coin from his father Ignis.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The majority of Cornelius House’s territory was occupied by forest, with little arable land. It couldn’t be described as a good situation for their finances, but even so they were still the house of a count. Their family was quite wealthy when compared to commoners in general.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The money that Ignis had given Baldr until now was 72 silver coins. If this amount was converted to the currency of modern Japan, it was the equivalent of 1.400.000 yen, more or less.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis gave his son pocket money each month since he was five years old in order to teach him the value of money and how to handle it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Baldr, who possessed knowledge from his previous life, naturally understood the worth of money.  He even understood to a certain degree how much influence financial affairs had on society.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If one were just looking at the result, what Ignis did was simply the trigger that awakened the instinct of the man sleeping inside Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fuhehehe……this shine is always nice, no matter how many times I see it……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Young master. I’ve said this every time, it’s creepy seeing you making such a face.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun knitted her pretty eyebrows seeing Baldr staring at the silver coin in delight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Geez! Even though the young master would be perfect if only he weren’t like this……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun became Baldr’s personal maid around five years ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis didn’t speak about the reason in detail, but it seemed to be caused by his parental love that wanted to give Baldr a friend of the same generation, since he was worried by Baldr’s unstable mind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because of that, Seyruun was also Baldr’s childhood friend. She herself also thought of Baldr as a cute little brother who was also a handful.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun nostalgically recalled the time when she was brought to meet with Baldr for the first time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr who was still six years old at that time was a boy with an attractive face and figure that everyone recognized.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, the speech and conduct that he sometimes showed would betray his appearance. It made Seyruun realize.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No, she was forced to realize.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Aren’t ye adorable?』 Baldr first said with a complacent smile and kind eyes, as though he was a doting grandfather toward Seyruun. And then Baldr suddenly yelled 『A little maid girl cameeee!』 with a red face while rolling around. He looked like her big brother who was three years older than her, who had been strongly influenced by a bad craze in the royal capital.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──She wished that he would stop sending glances toward her while blushing with that upward gaze.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although she was still an eight year old girl, as a female, she was sensitive towards such a gaze by nature.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In addition, Seyruun was also popular as a beautiful girl with her brown hair and reddish brown round eyes that she inherited from her mother, and her symmetrical facial features. She wasn’t good with that kind of gaze, since she was a child.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Onee-chan, want to play?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The one who talked with worried eyes to Seyruun when she was feeling such confusion wasn’t the boy who felt like a grandfather or someone that was like her strange big brother, but a slightly shy boy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun felt puzzled by Baldr’s personality that kept changing at the drop of a hat, but even so her desire to protect was incited by that worried gaze so much that she wanted to hug him. She bent her knee to match her line of sight with the boy and smiled.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Of course.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The instant she saw Baldr’s discouraged eyes, she thought of Baldr not as the eldest son of her lord who she should devote her loyalty to, but as a family member that she should treat with tender loving care.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since that day, Seyruun became like a guardian for Baldr in the place of Maggot. She became his big sister who he could fawn on and also a friend who was close to him in age.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the past Baldr was a delicate boy who was scared to even sleep alone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But now at eleven years old he had grown to become strong-willed and impudent. It made Seyruun sometimes seriously question if there was some kind of mistake.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sey-nee, tell me a story?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ufufu……young master really loves to hear old tales.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two would always be together, starting from the morning when Baldr woke up until nighttime when he went to sleep.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sey-nee is warm……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Hugging Baldr, who liked skinship and sleeping, greatly stimulated Seyruun’s motherhood.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If she had a little brother, would he be this adorable?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The more she felt Baldr’s body temperature the harder it was for her to let go. It made her unconsciously tighten her hug.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was starting to question whether her affection had gone too far, but even so she was unable to stop pampering Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     On the other hand, her attitude would change completely towards the other personalities that sometimes appeared.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『N-no bra body pillow……guhah! Ouch! It hurts! Buberah! Gefuu!』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「A punishment has to be painful.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『T-this is also good in its own way!』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Masaharu would look happy for some reason even though he was being hit. It made Seyruun get goosebumps and scream.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Get out of the young master already! This pervert!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The next day when Baldr woke up he muttered 「My cheeks hurt for some reason……」. Seyruun could only look at him with an extremely guilty face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As time passed and the two became conscious of Seyruun’s maturing womanly curve, the two didn’t sleep together any more. But actually, it only happened two years ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Until then they were together even when taking a bath, so it was only natural that Baldr was unable to oppose Seyruun.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Masaharu who sometimes excitedly yelled things like 『Real maid moeee-!』 with bloodshot eyes would be severely punished. Perhaps because of that he quickly stopped appearing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This is the only thing that I won’t budge on even if it’s Sey-nee……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The eleven years old Baldr let out a stifled laugh like a bad guy. He didn’t look like a little kid at all, as his appearance suggested.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was Baldr’s true nature that only Seyruun knew about. He didn’t show this side of him even to Maggot at this juncture.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun recalled the adorable Baldr with a distant gaze and let out a sigh that came from the bottom of her heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ve had enough. I’ve given up already……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Because I believe the young master won’t go astray from his own humanity……」 She didn’t say that. Because it would be troubling if Baldr who pointlessly had a lot of knowledge were to rampage even more than this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Kuhihi……the sensation of this cold silver is unbearable!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──I lied when I said I’ve given up. Kneel over there, young master.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The instant she saw Baldr rubbing his pocket money on his cheek lovingly, Seyruun realized that her thinking was shallow.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed it was necessary to strictly discipline Baldr once more in order to raise him to be the next head of the house, one that wouldn’t bring any shame to the Cornelius house no matter where he was.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s love for money didn’t start recently.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He loved money so much that it made one suspect that perhaps he had loved it since he was born.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Before Baldr had awareness about the things around him, even before his other personalities rose to the surface, Baldr had shown interest in silver or golden coins instead of baby’s toys.  He was a strange baby.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That tendency became striking since the memory of his past lives awakened when he was five years old.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A toddler who wouldn’t stop grinning when staring at a gold coin no matter how much time passed. That kind of eerie sight could often be found in the Cornelius House.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However fortunately or unfortunately, this strange habit of Baldr got remedied by Maggot who greatly misunderstood that Baldr liked shiny things.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Instead of a gold coin, she made the five year old hold a knife or a short sword and taught him how to handle sharp things. This was also an aberrant enough act that Baldr learned how dangerous it was to show his fixation towards gold coins in front of Maggot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After that, Baldr stopped showing his hyper fixation toward money in front of his parents.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was only Seyruun who was together with Baldr almost the entire day that he showed a glimpse of his true nature, to a degree that wasn’t too excessive.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course, this strange habit didn’t belong to Baldr himself or his previous life Oka Masaharu.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was the sinful disposition of a minor general who lived during the closing years of the Warring States period──Baldr’s previous previous life Oka Sanai.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Oka Sanai, only a serious Warring States maniac or people from the land that he once governed would know this name.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was born in the region of Wakasa. First he served Niwa Nagahide, a senior vassal of Oda Nobunaga. After that he was employed by Gamou Ujisato as a chief vassal. Due to Ujisato’s death there was an internal discord in the Gamou Clan and he moved to serve Uesugi Kagekatsu, a member of the Council of Five Elders (committee of daimyo formed by Toyotomi Hideyoshi to rule Japan until his son Hideyori came of age).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai was known as a person skilled in war. He frequently raised achievements on the battlefield, but his name was remaining in history mostly because of the way he amassed wealth.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai was also doing merchant-like activity like lending money to his colleagues and amassing wealth. He was the top money-maker in the Warring States era.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore, he wasn’t simply good at making money. It could be said that there was nobody who loved money as much as Sanai in the history of the Warring States period.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the same time, he was also known as a valorous warrior. Once he led less than 150 soldiers to toy with Date’s army that actually numbered around 15.000. There was also the time when he blew away Date Masamune’s helmet with a single swing of his spear and even drove him to a corner where he almost managed to finish him off.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He also had a spirit of chivalry as could be seen with how he burned up the debt contracts between him and his colleagues in the Uesugi Clan, whose territory had been reduced, and wrote off all their remaining debt which had amounted to quite a hefty size.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Sanai left the Uesugi Clan, Naoe Kanetsugu who once directly told 「Money is something dirty for a hand that is holding the war fan」 to Masamune was said to lament 「Uesugi Clan has lost a samurai who could be more useful for it than anyone else in the future」.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a true statement. At that time the Warring States period was ending and the era of civil administration was approaching. For the Uesugi Clan that was filled with a lot of muscle-brain generals, Sanai with his talent in money-making would be more precious than even gems in that new era.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because Baldr had Masaharu’s memory, he himself had the awareness to feel ashamed about this fetish. Even so, the depth of Sanai’s sinfulness in regards to the desire for money had gained victory in Baldr’s personality development during his childhood.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──I lied when I say I’ve given up. Kneel over there, young master.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr didn’t just want to rub the coin on his cheeks, he wanted to sniff the silver coin’s smell like a dog, and enjoy its metallic taste with his tongue. But he barely managed to suppress his lust.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because it couldn’t be said to be wise if he agitated Seyruun even more than this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m in the wrong. Please forgive me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Good grief……I hope young master is actually thinking that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun said that and let out a heavy sigh.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no way that Baldr would correct his conduct with just this. Seyruun who had lived together with him since they were little knew that better than anyone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, she was unable to be too harsh when Baldr prostrated himself before her without caring for his appearance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the end Seyruun herself was also weak against her adorable little brother.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then, I’m going out!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ah! Young master, please wait! I still haven’t finished talking!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sorry! I’ll listen when I go home!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr sprinted out from the mansion like an arrow. Seyruun could only place her hands on her waist and saw him off in exasperation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She knew that lately Baldr was secretly scheming something.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed like he was gathering the town’s children, but unfortunately the town’s brats had a strong sense of solidarity and wouldn’t tell her anything.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
<img src="img/035.jpg"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Sheesh, there will be punishment when you get home!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so Seyruun didn’t have even the slightest suspicion that Baldr would get involved with any wrongdoing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 2
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sey-nee is completely suspecting me……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, he was still glad that his maid was Seyruun. It was because she would still overlook Baldr going off and doing things sneakily.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If it was a maid who was normally hired and under the command of his parents, he would have already been reported a long time ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In that sense, Seyruun was Baldr’s childhood friend as expected. She was an important existence for him who was just like a big sister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Baldr-sama! We’ve been waiting!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr had gone up until the town. The one who appeared in front of him as they raised their voice energetically was Tyros(テュロス). He had a large build that was unthinkable for a 13 year old. He had confidence in his strength and planned to leave his family in the future to become a soldier.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was the third son of a tailor that was famous in the town. His facial features were well-ordered and his personality was also gentle and clever. He was plainly very capable, but for some reason he idolizes the younger Baldr from the bottom of his heart, and not just because Baldr was the son of the feuddal lord.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was so loyal that it was like he was a large dog that was completely devoted to its owner.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Though of course, it was because Baldr had knowledge and a personality that far surpassed what his age suggested due to the memory of his past lives.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yosh, let’s head to the secret base.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr headed to a small arable land on the outskirts of the town with Tyros following behind him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr had saved the pocket money that Ignis gave him and used the money to buy a barren land that had been neglected from a farmer for cheap. That land was now becoming a small farm with a size around 1 are (a hundred square meter).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aa! Baldr-sama! Look, look! It’s grown this big!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hey hey, is this thing tasty if they’re eaten?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Two children were watering the farm happily in high spirits.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two children were the boy Porco(ポルコ) whose father was a soldier and the girl Margo(マルゴ) who was the daughter of a merchant.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I guess it’ll be time for harvest soon. We’re saved the trouble because this crop doesn’t really need to be looked after that much.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr muttered while looking over the farm.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……I heard from Otou-san though. It seems this plant tastes bad and cannot be eaten, you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Eee~, that’s true? Baldr-sama?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Apparently Porco who had a strong curiosity had tried gathering information on his own.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     On the contrary, Margo who had a big appetite had her head filled with nothing but ideas of eating the harvest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Well, it’ll taste bad if you eat it as it is. Though the nutritional value isn’t bad even then.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr felt his cheeks loosening seeing the two’s reactions.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The three of them were older than him, but even then he felt that they were younger than him due to his previous lives’ memories.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Then, what are we going to do with this?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Tyros, who was the eldest among the three, took a peek at Baldr’s face with deep interest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no way that this thing was just a food that tasted bad, since it was Baldr who ordered them to make this farm.  His eyes showed a deep trust.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr felt embarrassed being looked at by such an earnest gaze. He became driven by a sense of mission that he had to answer Tyros’s great expectation, and so he answered with a puffed up chest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then let’s postpone the harvesting. Today I’ll teach you guys what we’re going to make with this.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hoorayyyyyy!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Tyros who was usually calm was jumping in happiness. It seemed like he was really curious about the crop’s true identity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (After all, not a single person here has noticed just what this is, even though it has been growing naturally in the mountain all this time.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr pulled out one of the crops that had grown big and walked toward a plain wooden hut that was built beside the farm with the three kids following behind him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then Margo, chop this into small pieces. Tyros and Porco, put some water into the pot and heat it over fire.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Understood!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The three children busily moved around to do the preparation. Baldr stared at them with a smile while secretly chuckling with a villainous face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Ku ku ku……this day finally arrived. It’s time to make a killing using a modern person’s information cheat!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The craving for money from Oka Sanai and the knowledge of Oka Masaharu who was slightly ill with chuunibyou were combined consistently inside Baldr. This actually happened around less than a year ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Until then, Baldr was living with three personalities. The boy Baldr, the high school student Masaharu, and then the old general who survived the Warring States period Sanai.  Their personalities would show up alternately each time there was something that strongly attracted their interest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr managed to safely grow up in such a condition was due to his parents’ unshakeable love, his interaction with Seyruun who was around the same age as him, and above all else, it was due to Maggot’s hellish training that Baldr wasn’t allowed to stay idle and worry about useless things.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Regardless of whether the harsh training that put his life at risk was something that was wished for or not, it matured the boy’s spirit and desired for the three personalities to join hands together for the sake of surviving to see tomorrow.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It could be said that the current Baldr who should be called the “Neo Baldr” was born in order to escape from Maggot’s evil clutches.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr trembled and held his head when he recalled the days that he wished to forget.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Right now the crop before his eyes was more important than recalling that hell.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the event of its completion……first he would save money to buy more lands. He would increase the number of workers and form a network with merchants……
    </span>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      ku ku ku, my dream is spreading infinitely!
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      .
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seeing Baldr like that, Margo, Porco, and Tyros looked at each other and whispered.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Baldr-sama is making that bad guy face again.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「When I see that face, I can be relieved that he is a kid like us……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No no, surely Baldr-sama is thinking about something that we can’t even imagine.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s mask had already been seen through by the children.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Now then, what Baldr was cultivating in the farm was actually sugar beet.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Beet, it was also called sugar radish. It was a plant that rivaled sugarcane as a raw material for sugar.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It had a lot of leaves, so it was used as a leaf vegetable, while the remaining root part was used as fodder for livestock. It was a food with a long history, but even on Earth it took a really long time before it was used as a raw material for sugar. Actually it was only starting from the middle of 18
    </span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     th
    </span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     century.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Aurelia Continent had a temperate climate. Here sugar could only be produced by the countries along the coast commencing with Santjuan(サンファン) Kingdom in the south. Of course, the sugar was made from sugarcane in those countries.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In other words, the idea of extracting sugar from sugar beet still didn’t exist in this world.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Have you properly cut it into fine pieces? Then let’s put them into the pot and boil it. Pay attention to the fire’s strength so that it won’t become too hot. This way will result in something delicious.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr gave instructions one by one.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hoorayyyy! It’ll be delicious just as I thoughttt!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmmm……I heard that the taste is bland though……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After that they quietly boiled it for an hour. Margo got bored in the middle, but Porco who was brimming with curiosity continued to adjust the fire while keeping watch quietly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This kind of perseverance was Porco’s characteristic. He would become a good guard like his father in the future.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yosh, lightly squeeze the boiled root using a cloth. Then boil it even more while scooping up the scum and then it’ll finish.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s all~~?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Margo tilted her head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Well, the amount of the finished product won’t be much but……you guys will surely be shocked.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There won’t be anything remaining if the juice is boiled down……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Porco didn’t look convinced, but after strengthening the fire for ten minutes, the sap that was squeezed out from the root was starting to thicken like starch syrup.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When the brown and thick liquid was moved on a plate, Margo ran out of patience and clung on Baldr’s right arm demandingly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hey, hey, can I eat this? This is the completed product right?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There isn’t much of it, so only lick a bit of it with your finger.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Then Porco and Tyros also reached out with their fingers impatiently.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Time to dig iiiin!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The three put their fingers in their mouths. Then they froze in that posture for a while.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「IT’S SWEE~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TT!!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The three let out a delighted voice. And then they became absorbed with bringing the beet sugar into their mouth.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In this continent, pure sugar made from sugarcane was a precious item that was hard to obtain.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Beekeeping also hadn’t spread. Because of that the commoners could only taste something sweet from fruits at this time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uwah! Amazing! Baldr-sama, I’ve never eaten something this sweet!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This is sugar isn’t it? How? How is a sugar created from this kind of garbage potato?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I can’t believe it, this is……amazing……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     With each lick Margo placed both her hands on her cheeks, with a face that looked like they would really fall off.  Porco and Tyros were showing pure shock from their whole body after learning that sugar could be extracted from an ingredient that nobody had ever even glanced at.  Baldr narrowed his eyes in satisfaction at their reaction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Now, with this my goal to raise fun is going to be achieved for the time being. But my ambition has only just started! More money! More, more! All the money! Let’s rake up so much money that it’ll be too tiresome to count it! And then that──no no no no, that one is no good. If I do that then it feels like it’ll be over for me as a human being. But, but……kuh! Even though it feels like this time a mountain of gold coins is within my reach……!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I wonder what’s wrong with Baldr-sama?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Margo looked confused. Tyros answered her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「He is thinking of something difficult right now.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Porco muttered quietly beside them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「He look like he’s writhing to me though……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As expected, even these three couldn’t possibly imagine that right now Baldr was fighting Sanai’s desire to cover the floor with gold coins and roll around naked on them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was repeating the same thing but, the extraordinary Warring States general Oka Sanai who cornered the one-eyed dragon Masamune and was only a step away from taking his head(furthermore with a small army force that didn’t even reach a hundredth of the enemy army), he had a certain strange habit that couldn’t be explained with any decent excuse at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It already wasn’t at the level of burning with a tenacity to save money with his lending business.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In reality, there were many generals other than Sanai who were also a miser with money. Famous generals like Fukushia Masanori or Katou Kiyomasa, they were misers who preached the importance of frugality and saving money to their descendants.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, just once a month Sanai would lock himself inside his residence and carried out a ritual alone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And shockingly that ritual was that he would cover the surface of a room with koban coins, strip naked, and feel the texture of the coins with his entire body.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fuhyahahaha! The feel of this gold is unbearable!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「These joys art what I’m living foorrrrrr!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Most likely even throughout the whole Japan, this man was the only one who carried out a version of bathing with money in the era of Warring States.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai was capable both as a warrior and as a domestic ruler, but it might have been that the influence of this particular hobby that couldn’t be told to other people was what made him change lords several times. That possibility certainly wasn’t zero.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Damn it, the money……the money’s evil power is leading me astray……endure! Endure it Baldr!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     About five minutes were necessary until Baldr recovered his serenity using his desperate perseverance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Remember, you mustn’t tell anyone about the sugar. Those who talk will instantly get kicked out of our group, I also won’t let them become my retainer. This is also a trial in order to become my retainer in the future, you all understand?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Of course!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’ll be fine~」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please leave it to me!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Porco, Margo, and Tyros all nodded strongly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr ordered the three who were still tense after tasting sugar for the first time in their life to harvest the remaining sugar beet, and then he headed to the shopping district.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was afternoon. The number of passersby on the street was increasing. Baldr was walking on the street and a single merchant house came into view.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a small building, but it had a refined atmosphere. A large sign with the words “Savaran Company” written on it was decorating the shop’s entrance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Are you making money?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「So-so, I guess.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s question was instantly replied to with words that sounded like a password. The one who replied was the owner of Savaran Company, Selina Savaran(セリーナ・サバラン).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Looks like it’s going well for ya, Baldr.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina showed a smile that was like a blooming flower. She was an 18 year old maiden.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her long and straight bridged nose, her rose colored small lips, and then her almond eyes gave the girl the aura of a capable beauty rather than a mere beautiful girl.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But for Baldr, his most important concern were the two ears on her head──they were two dog ears that drooped down right in the middle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Yes, she was a beastman.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Each time Baldr saw her ears with their first-rate fur, a desire to fluffle them to his heart’s content would strike him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had the feeling that if he could do that, he would be able to obtain the answer to the proposition of 「Dog ear or cat ear, which one is justice?」 that Masaharu was pondering even up until the point just before his death. But no matter how many times Baldr asked Selina, she would never allow him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Beastman wasn’t a rare race at all in Aurelia Continent.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The lineage of the hero Brocas(ブロッカス) who had a contract with the beast king Zoras(ゾラス) was propagated. The beastman race was split into the dog ear race and the cat ear race.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A lot of beastmen had better physical ability and five senses than humans, but it was only a slight difference. They were no match for the real dog and cat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In other words, they were just human, but with animal ears and a tail.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina’s father had unfortunately died in the past, and so she inherited her father’s company. But then her uncle was aiming to obtain her assets. Due to Selina’s good looks too, he tried to kidnap her. Baldr saved her from his attempt. That was how they met in the past.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina could vividly recall Baldr’s gallant figure at that time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Along with that recollection, she was unable to stop herself from feeling the sweet ache as a woman in her abdomen.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At that time Baldr was still nine years old, but Selina was convinced that his gallant figure wasn’t at all inferior compared to a hero in legend.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Savaran Company was a company that was opened by Selina’s father Massoud(マスード). He who was a peddler fell in love with Selina’s mother Lilia(リリア) and opened this company to settle down.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The company was small, but using the connections and market that he cultivated during his time as a peddler, this company was considered as a promising company within Cornelius territory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Massoud could continue running this company without any accident, it might have even been possible to develop this company into a distinguished and large company.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However Massoud was busy running around the kingdom looking for a cure to save Lilia, who was ill with an incurable illness that rotted away at her internal organs.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When he learned that the sickness couldn’t be cured even with the church’s divine spirit magic, he turned his hand toward a forbidden dark magic to exchange the rotted organs with his own organs.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At that time he had nothing else he could do but grasping at straws.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If Massoud was still thinking normally, there was no way he would try something suicidal like that. But with the death of his wife fast approaching, he didn’t have the composure to make a calm judgment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As a result, Massoud transferred his own organs to his wife and died.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Lilia also died soon afterwards, since her body showed a rejection towards organs that came from another person.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Thinking carefully, if there was that kind of convenient magic that could heal such an incurable disease, it would’ve been more well-known. Right now Massoud must be receiving an extremely severe scolding from Lilia in heaven.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her father was intelligent, had the ability to take action, and was also amiable, but he was always careless in some aspects like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And so the sixteen years old Selina was left alone. Two days after the funeral, her uncle from her mother’s side who she didn’t really know appeared before her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He intruded into the shop acting as if he owned the place, claiming that he would look after her as her guardian, so Selina replied 「This company is already mine ya know, I already registered it to the merchant guild and received permission」.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Then the uncle’s expression immediately changed to something like a demon’s, and he started trying to persuade her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He said, 『The company cannot be entrusted to a little girl with no experience』.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He said, 『I’m a renowned merchant even in the royal capital, so everything will go well if you leave the company to me』.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina who completely didn’t believe that her uncle was a capable merchant refused his suggestion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter how she looked at him, he was only a hyena aiming at her property. In fact, her observation was right on the dot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The uncle who knew that it was legally impossible to overturn Selina’s claim left Savaran Company after shouting filthy curses at her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She wasn’t so stupid and weak that she could be tricked by that kind of trash. Selina believed that, but just a few days later, Selina was made to realize that she had misjudged how much of a piece of trash her uncle was.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You damn little girl……I was just going to sell you off to a brothel if only you listened obediently.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sorry but I have high ideals when lookin’ for a man. I refuse to have anything to do with a pig.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was Selina’s carelessness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She must be feeling flustered too because she had only just inherited the company.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A regular customer approached her with a big business offer. When she thoughtlessly came to a warehouse that looked empty, her uncle was waiting for her there with a nasty smile and some thugs that followed his orders.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Do ya think that nobody will find out if you do something like this?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina tried threatening even knowing that it would be useless.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Murder for money would be sentenced with death, no exception. If Selina was killed, there was a high possibility her uncle would be suspected.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「A girl who lost both her parents fell into despair and drowned herself──there are a lot of stories like this. There won’t be any proof remaining if you drown.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ya-, fiend」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (If I die like this, I’ll get scolded by mum, just like dad……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina still didn’t plan to give up, but she resolved herself because the possibility was high that this place would be where she died.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There might be a chance if it was just her uncle alone, but the number of the thugs was eight. Furthermore, among them there were two brutal looking people who clearly had killed someone else before.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although beastmen had more or less better physical ability than humans, she immediately realized that this wasn’t a battle that she could win.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But, it was then──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Look at what we hath here. Some thugs art ganging up on a single cute child……』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a high pitched voice of a kid. Everyone there turned around in surprise. There they found a pretty boy that looked like an angel.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The boy──Baldr spoke something incomprehensible. His words sounded like a foreign language and no one there was able to understand him, but from his atmosphere he was clearly hurling insults at her uncle and his gang.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This brat!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Thinking normally, Baldr looked like a poor victim who got involved in an incident.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However just from looking at Baldr’s eyes, Selina was convinced that she was saved for some reason.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Just like how people would come to a realization when they saw a lion or a tiger, just by looking at the eyes of the strong their strength would be conveyed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Beastmen were especially sensitive to such things.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oi, kill him. Brat, curse your own stupidity in that world.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『What, so ye guys art bored of living? Now I’m pissed off……』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The thugs must be thinking that it would be no trouble to pin down or kill a boy that was smaller than even Selina.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They reached out toward the boy with vulgar smirks. Baldr moved at that instant like lightning.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It truly happened in a flash.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He stole a blade from the pocket of the nearest thug and stabbed his throat without a shred of hesitation. And then he stabbed the heart of another person in a single flowing motion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr stole the sword that man was equipped with. At the same time he threw his blade with the speed and precision of a trained hand. The third thug that was approaching was defeated with that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr swung around the long one-handed sword that didn’t suit his small body as a warm-up exercise, then he provoked Selina’s uncle and his thugs with a fearless grin.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『This sword is a bit hard to use but, oh well. Let’s fight, ye morons.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina’s uncle and his thugs opened their eyes wide seeing the disdainful expression that Baldr sported.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was clearly an arrogance that the strong would show to the weak in that look.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     These thugs were in a position that was looked down upon by society due to them daily taking advantage of someone else’s weakness. It was impossible for them to mistake the kind of expression that Baldr showed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「T-t-this brat! Kill him! Kill him already!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At this time the two brutal looking men had sensed that Baldr wasn’t an ordinary kid from the air that he gave off.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     On the other hand, the other thugs who only measured Baldr from his appearance rushed forward in high spirits to take revenge for their friends. However Baldr’s small body vanished from view at the next moment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr crouched low near the ground and cut off the shin of three people.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「GYAAAAAAAAA!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was nobody who could stand after they lost their dominant leg.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr didn’t even spare a glance at the men writhing in intense pain and threw a knife toward Selina’s uncle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hih……hiiiii!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her uncle’s scream sounded closer than Selina expected. She unconsciously leaned back and turned around.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed that her uncle had secretly closed the distance to take her hostage. He was a sleazebag in all respects.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ve paid you guys a lot of money! You guys get that? Kill that brat already!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her uncle dodged the knife just barely and gave the order. In response the brutal looking men finally took action. They were emitting killing intent that was at a different level from a mere thug.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so it didn’t cause the slightest change on Baldr’s composed bearing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was because he had instinctually sensed that the men had only ever fought opponents that were weaker than him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    『That
    <ruby>
     Hahago-dono
     <rt>
      Maggot
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    is hundreds of times scarier than this.』
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr didn’t hesitate.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He casually walked toward the opponents as though he was walking on an empty field.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Thinking that they were being underestimated, the two men slashed with a movement that was far more refined than the other thugs, but that was all there was to it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr dodged the sword and slipped onto the chest of one of the men, then he lifted up the man from his waist and threw him down on the ground. His heel then immediately came down on the man’s throat with his entire body weight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Gegeh!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man let out a groan that sounded like it was squeezed out from his lungs before he stopped moving.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The other man felt cold sweat trickling from his whole body seeing the boy wordlessly stamping his partner to death without showing any openings at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I can’t win. We are quite confident in our skill, but he just got stamped to death like a worm. There is no way I can win against this kind of opponent.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the corner of his eye, the man saw his employer persistently still trying to approach the girl.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oi, look there. The girl is going to die, you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man who sensed his defeat ran away at full speed while saying that over his shoulder at the same time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man was already three steps away from the sword range at the instant Baldr’s attention was turned toward Selina.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The man kept running with increasing speed. He sighed in relief believing that he had escaped the danger to his life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Gatsun!*
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Humans can die even from a thrown rock, see?』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A slightly flat rock that could be found on the riverbed hit the back of the man’s head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even such a rock that could be found anywhere could become a weapon that stole a human’s life if it was in Baldr’s hand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A lot of blood flowed from the head of the man who fainted and collapsed. The ground was dyed red.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It didn’t matter whether his flame of life sputtered or not, he wouldn’t stand up again.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「D-don’t move!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina who was entranced by Baldr’s movement remembered that her uncle was trying to take her hostage when she heard that voice.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What a fool. Even though he might be able to at least keep his life if he ran away.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Throw away your sword! Don’t you care what’s going to happen to this girl!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina wondered if there would be any meaning in taking her hostage when she didn’t know this boy at all, but it seemed her uncle couldn’t understand that with all the blood that rushed into his head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『I can kill ye faster than ye can kill that girl.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Just throw away your sword! You hear──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     *Hyun* There was the sound of cutting wind. At the same time, a sword caved her uncle’s forehead in and he died with blood spurting out.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He didn’t even know what had happened before he died.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Selina couldn’t see Baldr throwing the sword at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As she expected, there was no meaning in taking her hostage, but in an entirely different meaning from what she expected.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I, I’m in yer debt……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina bowed to show her gratitude.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      I don’t think that there’ll be any problem but, I still can’t understand this boy’s language, so let’s refrain from provoking this boy needlessly
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──the instant Selina thought that, her knees folded and she sank down on the floor.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When she looked at her feet, she noticed they were shaking.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The fact that she almost got killed had finally caught up to her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fueh?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Suddenly a warm hand patted her hand at that timing. A stupid voice slipped out from Selina’s mouth.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Errr, I’m sorry, did I scare you?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When she noticed, Baldr was now talking with the continent’s official language that she was familiar with. He embraced Selina’s head and continued to pat her hair kindly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although Selina didn’t notice that Baldr’s gaze was fixed on her dog ears.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Dog ears……real dog ears……another world rocks!』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr muttered other incomprehensible words while smiling awkwardly. It was an innocent face that was completely far removed from like the person who emitted killing intent like that of a demon god until just now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina was moved to tears from the feeling of relief, but then she snorted in laughter seeing Baldr’s panicked state.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina was immersed in that recollection while looking at the eleven year old Baldr in front of her who had grown taller and more masculine.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He had good looks which gave off a friendly charm that would surely be well received among women. He had truly grown into a figure that was just to Selina’s liking.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Try licking this.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There isn’t much of it eh……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t ask for extravagance when it’s just a trial product.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina tossed the brown pill that Baldr handed to her into hre mouth.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A sweetness with unique depth to it melted at the tip of her tongue. Selina’s eyes immediately narrowed in happiness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Nn~~~! Sweetness is the bestttt!!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although Selina owned a company, sugar wasn’t a product that could be tasted that easily even for her. Not only was it expensive, the amount of sugar that was circulating in this world was absolutely insufficient in the first place.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「So?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It will depend on the person’s preference but, as for me I like this sugar better.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yossha!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr cheered and clenched his right hand into a fist and pulled back his elbow.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina didn’t understand the meaning of that gesture Baldr made, but it still conveyed Baldr’s happiness to her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I want to make this as our territory’s local specialty, but growing the crops themselves is easy. One day it will surely be exposed. That’s why I decided to use it to make money for the sake of the next step. I’m planning to expand the planting of the crops.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「And ya gonna leave the sales to us for that eh?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yep, that’s why let me touch your ears already──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s hand reached out toward the dog ears that had great fur. But Selina pinched his palm and smiled mischievously.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m not that cheap of a woman ya know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Beastwoman would only allow their ears to be touched by a man who they opened up their heart to.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In her heart Selina thought that she was alright if it was with Baldr, but she didn’t want to give him permission when he asked with a joking attitude like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he would love her as a woman then……she wouldn’t be unwilling.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Too bad. But to be more exact, what I mean is a bit different from leaving the sales to you I guess?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……hoo」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selena sensed that there was a hidden meaning in Baldr’s words and changed her expression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In one part due to the strong impression that Baldr left in her when he saved her, Selina herself didn’t think of Baldr as a mere eleven year old like his appearance suggested.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She especially felt that when she saw his mischievous smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Actually, I want you to lend me the name of your company. Of course I’ll have to rely on Selina to do much of the practical business but, I want to move the money following my plan.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……How far are ya going to meddle?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Only with the fundamental policy. What to buy. What to invest in. Will it be full price or half price? I’ll leave the rest to Selina’s own judgment.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「And how much is gonna be our share?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How about ten percent of the profit? I’ll also pay the cost for using your company’s name.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina quietly leaned forward and brought her face closer, up to the point as if she were a lover about to give a kiss.  She glared at Baldr with rough nasal breathing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ya rate us too cheaply, thirty percent.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll be the one who funds it all. The profit you’ll get is already enormous. Fifteen percent.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Doesn’t matter what ya gonna sell or how much ya promised, it’ll all be just a pipe dream without our cooperation right? Besides, do ya have anyone else who ya can rely other than me? Thirty percent.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina was far more obstinate than Baldr imagined. She showed no sign of lowering her price at all. Baldr scratched his head with a troubled look.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was true, he had no other acquaintance other than Selina who he could ask to do this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a financial product that didn’t need any capital guarantee, so there wouldn’t be any risk for Selina in this work anyway……that was his lighthearted thought before, but it seemed that he underestimated the matter too much.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was easy to concede here, but thirty percent……who knew how much money that would be in the future. He was reluctant to part with that much money. It felt like his body was being cut all over!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In that case──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Then, I’m fine giving you thirty percent if you let me touch your ears.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Guh!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The unexpected retort made Selina the one who went red and get taken aback this time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina overcharged the price simply because it was galling for her to let everything go Baldr’s way.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She knew that Baldr had no one else other than her who he could rely on, but in the unlikely event that she lost her connection with Baldr here, Selina would be the one with a greater loss instead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s invention would undoubtedly produce a huge fortune. Naturally Selina too wasn’t seriously thinking of refusing Baldr’s proposal.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The dangled carrot that was a thirty percent share and the desire of her maiden heart to use this good chance to take a step further in her relationship with Baldr made Selina hesitate with a bright red face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I-if it’s just for a bit……just this once okay?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina even forgot her own words just now 「I’m not that cheap of a woman」 and presented her droopy ears that were laying flat on her head toward Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (That’s right. This is for the thirty percent share. It’s not because I want Baldr to touch them……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Funyah!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The feeling of Baldr’s slender fingertips rubbing the tip of her ears made a sigh slip out from Selina’s mouth.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina felt ticklish, but there was also euphoria that was filling her heart. She unconsciously narrowed her eyes and concentrated all her focus into her ears.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her shoulders were shaking slightly. Her ears were laying flat as though in fear. Those things were stirring up Baldr’s excitement.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The memory of Masaharu who was ill with chuunibyou resurrected at the back of Baldr’s mind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Dog ear is justice──the question of which was better, dog or cat. That proposition which he thought would go unanswered for eternity was now answered. Baldr was convinced of that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (T-this fluffy feeling……it’s irresistible!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Nn……fukyuu……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina was leaking out small cries like a puppy. She definitely didn’t dislike having her ears touched. It was clear when looking at her fluffy tail that was wagging energetically.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr enjoyed the silky texture of the ear’s fine fur. Baldr who had his long standing desire fulfilled wasn’t satisfied with just that. He persistently rubbed the pink colored back of the ear which was a sensitive spot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then unexpectedly he leaned forward. He couldn’t resist the command of his desire that was going berserk.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「DON’T GET CARRIED AWAYYYYYYY!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Guhah!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s stomach became completely open because he tried to embrace Selina’s small head. Selina’s full powered attack which hit that place sent Baldr flying for three meters.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a splendid body blow from Selina that didn’t give any opportunity for Baldr to react, even with his skills in martial arts.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「J-just a little! I told ya just a little! What’s more it was my first time my ears were touched, and yet ya weren’t holding back at all……!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
<img src="img/062.jpg"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seeing Selina’s flushed face and her teary eyes, Baldr realized that he had overdone it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Fluffiness was certainly justice, but a woman’s tears overturned even justice!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I was in the wrong.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Th-this time is an exception ya got it? I won’t allow ya to touch them next time if ya can’t be gentler.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yahoo! After two years of dogged perseverance, finally fluffing privilege GETTTTTTTTT!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「O-only when I give the permission okay? I won’t let ya touch them that easily no matter what!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That way of touching was dangerous to their reasoning──mainly to Selina.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Can I ask the two of you what have been you doing just now?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Eh?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A voice suddenly spoke. When they turned toward the voice, there was the head clerk of Savaran Company, Rorona(ロロナ) making an exasperated face that was slightly blushing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「NOOOOOOOO!!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr and Selina screamed in embarrassment when they noticed her standing awkwardly there.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Good grief, president should be old enough to know better……well, you aren’t that old yet but, president is still the proud head of this company, so you have to be a bit more level headed.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I have no excuse.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina was seriously dejected from the calm scolding of her trusted confidant Rorona.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rorona was a senior employee in this company who was raised by Selina’s father and mother as a candidate for the company’s future top brass.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so she was still 26 years old. She was an alluring maiden with beautiful black hair that was tied into a bun and had a curvy body.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There had been countless men who tried to woo her since the past, but there still wasn’t any romantic gossip about her. Selina couldn’t help but felt that it was a waste, even though it wasn’t her problem.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──It’s none of president’s business.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「But I didn’t say anything!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina wasn’t incompetent by all means, but she was still unable to oppose Rorona.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In fact, the majority of Savaran Company’s practical business was still taken care of by Rorona with her outstanding ability to deal with paperwork.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Young master Baldr, it appears that you’re going to do something interesting, but, if you allow our company to be involved in it then a share of twenty percent will be enough for us.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The share amount she proposed was smaller than the number Selina insisted just now. But Selina seemed to trust Rorona and didn’t interrupt her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……You will have to take responsibility for the risk on your own, you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Of course, we shall have to adequately scrutinize whether this work will have that much worth or not.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rorona seemed to be shrewder than Baldr thought. If he wasn’t careful, Savaran Company might take over this business that he was going to start with their overwhelmingly superior amount of capital.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This company had the capability to carry out Baldr’s plan on a scale that was dozens of times bigger.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please don’t worry. We won’t do anything dishonorable toward our important customer.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rorona smiled as though to say that she had seen through Baldr’s thinking.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In fact she had really seen him through.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Thinking carefully, if Baldr used the connection of his father Ignis, he would be able to make use of a company that was bigger than Savaran Company.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no way the sharp-witted Selina and Rorona would do anything dishonest when the other party was a precious source of revenue like the heir of a count house.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr scratched his head bashfully before he nodded at Rorona.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If that’s so then, take care of me from here on as a partner.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rorona grinned boldly and then she muttered 「Right right」 as though there was something that she had recalled just now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Although the young master called it the compensation for the share increase, but please refrain from toying with the president’s ears too much. For beastman, the only one they will allow to touch their ear is only a member of the opposite sex that they have no problems even entrusting themselves to. Though it’ll be different if young master Baldr wants to accept the president as a partner in both public and private matters.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ueh?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Seriously?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina went bright red until her neck and let out a strange scream. Beside her Baldr realized that somehow he had stepped on an outrageous landmine.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Although it looks like president herself doesn’t seem disagreeable with it.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「E-enough! Rorona! I’ll be angry if ya keep this up!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please pardon my impertinence.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rorona’s dignity was completely winning here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina would act like a shrew older lady in front of Baldr, but as expected she was at a disadvantage when in front of Rorona who had taken care of her since she was a child.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then, can you quickly arrange to sell this sugar in the capital? Then using that money……there is something that I want you to buy, as many as possible──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Just where have you been loitering at!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the evening, what greeted Baldr when he returned to the mansion was his father Ignis who was standing imposingly at the entrance with an angry expression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His father was wearing a gorgeous outfit and there was also the smell of perfume from him. Baldr went 「Ah」 in realization of his blunder after seeing his father’s appearance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Come to think of it……there is a party tonight.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t forget that kind of thing! Go change your clothes quickly! Good grief……even though you’re the star tonight!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m sorry, I’ll hurry.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His mother was training him hard just like usual in the morning, so he completely forgot. He wondered what she would do if he got terribly injured this morning from that training……?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He guessed that she would say something like「Just think of that wound as a badge of honor. Enough with the tedious talk, get out already to the party」 without giving a damn. He could imagine Ignis holding his stomach due to the pain if that happened.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although it would be just Ignis reaping what he sowed for falling in love with someone like Maggot, as expected, even Baldr couldn’t help but feeling pity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Now then, let’s prepare so that Tou-san’s stomachache won’t get worse than this.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr rushed to return to his room. There, Seyruun was waiting for him with a very dark smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Young master Baldr, you return early.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uh……sorry……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was awkward.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr felt a chill like there was a block of ice thrust into his back. He desperately bowed his head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Master and mistress asked me, where the young master? Does the young master have any idea just how embarrassing it was for me when I couldn’t answer them?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun stared blankly at Baldr to express her resentment. Baldr could only prostrate himself to apologize.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis wasn’t a tyrannical lord so Seyruun wasn’t punished, but even so, if this were another noble house it would even be possible for Seyruun to have been fired.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr only noticed now that his thinking was too naïve.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As expected Seyruun wasn’t just a mere maid for Baldr, for him she was an important existence that was like his big sister and also his childhood friend.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the first place without her at his side, it was extremely doubtful whether Baldr could maintain his personality’s identity like right now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr obediently kept his head bowed and apologized to Seyruun from the bottom of his heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──I’m really sorry. I’ll talk properly with Sey-nee too from now.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To be honest, Baldr had also felt that there was a limit to progress with the business discussion while keeping it a secret from Seyruun. It would be best to properly explain the situation to her and win her over as his ally.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even from Baldr’s perspective, Seyruun had gone above beyond being a mere maid. She was definitely an excellent assistant for him even if she was evaluated without Baldr’s bias.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please don’t do something like this anymore. Then, let’s hurry to change clothes.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun too couldn’t stay angry anymore than this after her cute little brother apologized to her by bowing his head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun smiled wryly at how weak she was against young master Baldr while pulling his hand to make him change into the dress suit that had been tailored for the party.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Tonight would be the first time for the eldest son of Count Cornelius, Baldr Cornelius to show himself in a formal setting.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Normally the debut of a noble’s eldest son would be done when they were around five years old. The reason why Baldr’s debut was delayed until he was eleven years old was because Baldr had a weak constitution. That was the rumor that mainly spread.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For the nobles in the vicinity of Cornelius territory, regardless whether they liked the count or not, the strength of the next generation who would shoulder Cornelius house in the future was a serious matter of interest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It might not really matter if it was about a royal court noble in the royal capital, but Cornelius House was an existence that couldn’t be made light of for the military authorities and the nobles near the border.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Count Cornelius’s territory was the cornerstone on the national border with Haurelia Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although the two countries were currently at peace, it was hard to say that the relationship between the two had improved. Count Cornelius still had a heavy responsibility in regard to the national defense.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although it was also true that due to welcoming a mere mercenary as his legal wife, Ignis was said to dirty the noble’s blood and his reputation among the nobles had fallen.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because of that, the number of people that was invited for the party tonight was extremely few if one were to take the Cornelius House’s fortune into consideration.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Long time no see, Ignis.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It looks like you haven’t changed, Mattis(マティス).」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two men exchanged a firm handshake and hugged each other’s shoulders.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Ignis who was hated by upper class nobles, this man was one of the few people who he could call as a close friend. Mattis Bradford(マティス-ブラッドフォード), he was Ignis’s comrade in arms in the past war.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Right now he was succeeding the viscount house of Bradford at the northwest region of the kingdom, but he belonged to the Blue Flame Knight Order of the kingdom army during the war.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His house was also known as a military family, even if it weren’t to the extent of the Cornelius House. The military strength that he possessed wasn’t something that could be underestimated.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis’s eyes moved toward the girl beside Mattis who was looking up at him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Teresa(テレサ) has also grown big huh.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uncle yourself is also looking healthy. By the way, where is Baldr? I want to meet him after so long.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「He is still changing clothes right now. I think he’ll come soon though.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa was a beautiful girl with red hair that suited her looks. She grinned broadly. Her appearance looked like a lively boy at a glance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「As expected, I’ll hold myself back tonight, but be ready to see me taking a win against Baldr tomorrow, uncle. I also have grown a lot stronger since then!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When his best friend Ignis sent him a wordless question asking just what was the meaning of this, Mattis could only shake his head in resignation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Despite her beautiful looks, for a noble lady Teresa was a bit too lively for these few years──to be frank, she had grown to be a tomboy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Mattis couldn’t help but feel disappointed by that because it was a waste of his daughter’s lovely appearance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He hesitated to say it out loud but, at this rate his daughter might become a female warrior just like Maggot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In Mattis’s mind, he had a silly thought that perhaps Baldr would break his daughter’s high confidence and if possible would become the husband of his unworthy daughter in the future.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As the eldest son of Cornelius House, there wasn’t any problem with Baldr whether in status or in the political aspect to be his daughter’s husband.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However that expectation ended in vain. Since that day when Teresa witnessed Baldr receiving Maggot’s harsh training despite being younger than her, Baldr had become a target that should be surpassed one day for Teresa.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa didn’t understand why she was feeling this strongly about it, but there was a side of her that absolutely didn’t want to lose against Baldr alone.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s great that both Lord Ignis and Lord Mattis are in good health. And it seems your eldest son has also grown up to be a splendid young man. This old man is happy to know that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A good-natured old man appeared. Ignis and Mattis straightened their posture in panic and bowed to him politely.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「G-General Ramillies(ラミリーズ)! Welcome, it’s a honor to see you here!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This Ramillies had no peerage, but he was an authority in the kingdom’s army. Currently there was no one who had raised as many achievements as him. And not only that, he was also Mattis’s superior in the past.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though he was already past sixty years old, his wide shoulders and broad chest hadn’t looked emaciated at the slightest even now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His hair had turned white and lost its luster, but his sharp gaze and his tanned skin conveyed that he was still an active military man even now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It was a great loss for the Blue Flame Knight Order when Lord Mattis succeeded the lordship of your house. If possible, I wish that you could’ve taken up the seat as the knight order’s commander for several years first.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That honor is too much for my incompetent self.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Mattis bowed with a feeling of obligation that came from the heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies who was a commoner was intentionally talking in a self-depreciating way, but in the past he was a demonic superior whom no one dared to oppose.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore when Ramillies fought seriously, the possibility of Mattis winning wasn’t that high even when considering Ramillies’s old age.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis also knew of the way Ramillies fought that caused him to be called as the demon god of the battlefield. Just like Mattis, he was unable to raise his head against Ramillies at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     On the other hand──.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ooh! Jii-sama, you still haven’t croaked yet.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ha ha ha. I was also looking forward to see if Silver Light-dono had become slightly more like a wife.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m always acting ladylike even though I look like this. But with our relationship, there isn’t any need for us to keep up appearances with each other at this point.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……To be honest I still can’t believe it even now. To think that tomboy would become Lord Ignis’s wife.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I also think so too from the bottom of my heart about that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot laughed loudly and slapped the back of the stiffening Ignis hard.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What are you doing standing around with a dumb look like that. Show Jii-sama inside already.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「R-right……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis knew that Maggot and Ramillies had some kind of relationship with each other since the time Maggot was a mercenary.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis and Maggot at first received a total objection from Ignis’s relatives and it was really hard for them to marry. But then the king recognized their marriage. Ignis suspected that it might be because of Ramillies’s help.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies didn’t accept peerage and stayed a commoner, so it was strange for him to have such political influence, but if Ramillies was ordered to lead an army, most likely there wasn’t even a single person in the military right now who could rival Ramillies’s skill.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If this old man who was even more precious than gems asked for a favor, then perhaps even the king would listen without saying anything.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「By the way Jii-sama, can you take a look at my son’s skill later? After all that kid is going to become a warrior who surpasses me before long.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……If you aren’t joking, then this is where I should tell you to keep your doting to your son in moderation you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although Ramillies replied to Maggot casually like that, his eyes were giving a sharp glint.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As far as Ramillies knew, people who could rival Maggot in battle strength individually like Ignis or Mattis could be counted on one hand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore if her battlefield intuition was also taken into consideration, then Maggot was the strongest warrior in the continent that Ramillies knew.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If there was someone who surpassed that Maggot, then it wasn’t something that he could just leave alone in various senses.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Setting aside my spear, my skill in magic and sword is self-taught. So I want to ask Jii-sama’s opinion.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……You don’t even need to ask me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     To repeat, the talent of Ignis’s successor was a big concern for the kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a public secret that Haurelia Kingdom hadn’t given up on invading the Mauricia Kingdom even now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The upper streams of most of the rivers flowing through Haurelia Kingdom were located in Mauricia Kingdom. In addition, Mauricia Kingdom was blessed with various resources. For Haurelia Kingdom, the land of Mauricia Kingdom was something that they historically coveted and had to be annexed at all cost.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Cornelius House had woodland territory which was an area with high defensive ability. Even so, they were continuously being exposed to the great threat of the Haurelia Kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the worst case that the lord there was incompetent, the Cornelius territory would be immediately trampled by the Haurelia Kingdom unless Mauricia Kingdom immediately took countermeasures.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In fact Ramillies was also secretly ordered by the king to observe Baldr’s disposition closely.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There wouldn’t be any problem in the immediate future, but depending on the situation it might even be possible for the king to interfere with the succession of Cornelius House.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course the king wouldn’t be able to avoid the backlash from the nobles within the country if he interfered like that, but the Cornelius territory was just that important.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of course there wouldn’t be any problem at all if Baldr possessed a talent that was worthy to be the heir.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then if by any chance he really possessed a talent that surpassed both his parents, then there would also be another choice that could be considered.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot looked satisfied that she was able to surprise a veteran like Ramillies. She turned around with her magnificent crimson dress trailing behind her and walked to where Ignis was standing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun gracefully appeared wearing a blue dress looking like a noble lady who had been invited to the party herself. Seeing her appearance informed Ignis that Baldr had finished his preparation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It seems the preparation is finished. Well then everyone, please take your glasses inside the hall.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr looked in embarrassment at himself, wrapped up in formal wear that looked like a white tuxedo. Seyruun seemed to be satisfied with the result, but he himself couldn’t help but feel that there were too many decorations on his outfit.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The Warring States general Sanai preferred to wear gaudy attire, but in the end that was only limited to the battlefield. Normally he would always dress plainly instead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From the perspective of Baldr’s other previous life Masaharu, his current appearance didn’t look any different from his friend who was doing cosplay at Harumi Wharf.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Speaking of the formal dress for Masaharu who was an ordinary high school student, it would be just his school blazer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……It can’t be helped. This too is the duty of a noble.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr let out a big sigh and resolved himself before he started walking toward the stage where the attending guests were watching.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I can’t express how grateful I am to everyone here who graced us with your presence today for the sake of our family. We are holding this meager party to introduce our eldest son Baldr. Everyone, I hope you will keep honoring us with your friendship from now on too.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr waited for Ignis’s signal and stepped into the second’s floor stage that was shaped like a balcony.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Allow me to introduce myself. I am the only child of Cornelius House, my name is Baldr Cornelius. Although incompetent, so that I won’t besmirch the name of our family, I shall risk my life if it’s required to become this kingdom’s shield and protect the people together with my father. Here and now I swear to everyone that I shall never display anything unsightly in battle.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Baldr came to himself, he realized Ignis was watching him with his mouth hanging open.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Damn it! I was too nervous and spoke exaggeratingly like Sanai……!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot had been pointing at him since some time ago while holding her stomach in laughter. O mother, that was not how a mother should act toward her son, was it not?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph, it’s just Baldr and yet he acted cheeky like that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa muttered with a huff.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I won’t tell you to follow that example but, that’s how a proper noble should be, Teresa.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even I can give that kind of speech if it’s now……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa’s unveiling was when she was six years old.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even when her age was taken into consideration, she still didn’t want to recognize how splendid her rival childhood friend looked.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa sulked with puffed up cheeks. Mattis had a silly thought of how cute she was being. At the same time he also felt defeated toward his best friend in the matter of raising children.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Before the party Baldr was rumored that perhaps he was born with a weak constitution and perhaps even an inborn disability. But his magnificent speech just now caused the hall to be filled with a stir.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so most of the attending nobles were thinking that Baldr’s speech was just following the script that had been prepared beforehand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even for a noble who was demanded to have responsibility and self-awareness since a young age, it didn’t seem possible for an eleven years old child to be able to talk like that, as expected.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s quite a splendid showing.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「He seems to be a son with good future prospects.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Cornelius House can also be relieved for the time being with this.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmph, hopefully this isn’t just a mere show.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Among the guests there were also those who couldn’t wipe their bias toward Cornelius House, but the guests’ evaluation toward Baldr was favorable in general.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However Mattis and Ramillies realized that Baldr’s speech wasn’t something that Ignis prepared for him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Especially the old general Ramillies, he shuddered when he sensed the presence that Baldr showed just for an instant.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He realized that fact as someone who had survived through the battlefields for a long time. He reflexively glared toward Maggot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He thought that it was too fast to make a kid this young experience something like that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was the experience──of killing a human.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It didn’t matter how young and childish he looked at the surface, it didn’t matter even if there was no change in his attitude, there would definitely be a change on the inside when a man killed another man.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Humans were that kind of creature.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr didn’t look like a boy who would commit murder just for fun, but at the very least there should be a wound carved into Baldr’s heart that wouldn’t disappear for his whole life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For those who lived with martial arts, killing a human was an experience that would come sooner or later, it was a trial. Humans who couldn’t kill another person wouldn’t be able to become a warrior no matter how skilled they were.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Therefore a part of the nobility had the custom to make their children carry out the execution of death penalty.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so Ramillies never heard of something so reckless as making an eleven year old child do that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I swear I would never make that child do anything like that. Even I don’t know when that child graduated from his virginity. Though I think it’s from about two years ago.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot noticed Ramillies’s gaze and shrugged with a mischievous smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Two years ago, the memories of Sanai and Masaharu were still in a chaotic state inside Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     During that time, most likely something happened that developed into a situation where it would be kill or be killed and Sanai’s personality came to the front──that was Maggot’s guess.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In fact the incident with Selina’s case was two years ago. So Maggot’s guess was completely true.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You are still his mother no matter what, so you should at least know what kind of situation it was that made your son graduate from his first time.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies let out a long sigh at the statement of Maggot whose absurdity hadn’t changed since the past.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In what world was there a mother who could be found allowing her son to do as he pleased even after that son had committed murder.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Murder at childhood could especially cause a big trauma.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Depending on the situation, there were even people who became a hunter that thirsted for blood instead to escape the shock of killing people. Those people would become unable to leave the battlefield.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Well, there was a bit of a special circumstance. Even like this, I believe I can still understand whether my son’s sword is cloudy.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot smiled with complete calm.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although she might not be much of a mother, Maggot’s learning wasn’t so inadequate that she could be deceived.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot believed that the reason Baldr killed someone wasn’t something that slighted his own justice. She also believed that Baldr wasn’t drowning in his own strength and he also wasn’t caught in darkness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although she had also ordered a retainer to secretly investigate Baldr’s relationship with Selina.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot looked really uncaring and relaxed with nurturing her son by not giving any interference, but she actually was a doting parent with a tsundere personality.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Good grief, you mother and son are really bad for this old man’s health.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the same time Ramillies thought that it was a waste of talent.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As the eldest son of Cornelius House, in the end Baldr would have to content himself as being a mere feudal lord of a remote region.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The scale of Cornelius House was relatively large at the kingdom’s eastern border, but in the whole kingdom it ranked around the 40
    </span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     th
    </span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     . The house was around medium-level as an upper class noble, while its influence in politics belonged in the low rank instead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If only Baldr was a second son, Ramillies would immediately bring him back with him to raise him in the knight order with special education gifted children.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Baldr finished giving greetings in general, the small nobles swarmed him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After they learned that the rumor of his sickness was wrong and he was actually a boy with good prospects, he became an existence that they wished to have a connection with by all means.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please come visit our house sometimes. Our house has a daughter of the same age as the young master……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I have just purchased a precious spear from our house’s regular merchant, so if you can take a look at it──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How about coming to look at our house’s prided garden next time? Next month it will be the best season to watch flowers.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although Cornelius House only ranked around 40
    </span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     th
    </span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     place, for the small nobles who ranked far below that, Cornelius House was a large house that was enticing enough. Furthermore, as could be seen from how Ignis took in Maggot who was a mercenary as his first wife, it was an extraordinary house that wasn’t too fixated on a noble’s status.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In other words, Baldr was an excellent article that might take their daughter to be his first wife.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr looked troubled with so many people surrounding him, but he smiled as though he was enjoying the situation. A red haired beautiful girl appeared at that time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She calmly raised a hand and commanded the nobles who were swarming Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Excuse me, but can you please move away from there?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Eei! Right now isn’t the time for……o-oh, isn’t this the young lady of Bradford House?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I want to talk with my best friend after such a long time. Can you please concede this spot for me?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Y-yes……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Unable to directly oppose the young lady of a viscount house, the small nobles who swarmed Baldr reluctantly opened a path for Teresa.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fuu, I can finally take a breather with this. Thanks a lot, Teresa.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aren’t you getting even cheekier after we haven’t met for a while, Baldr?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Cheeky you say……I don’t think that I’ve acted like that though.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Their words seemed to be sarcastic but, the two of them looked at each other and laughed in enjoyment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The first meeting of Teresa and Baldr could be traced to when Baldr was still troubled by the three personalities when he was six years old.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That day Teresa, who was a year older than Baldr, was brought by her father Mattis to meet with Ignis and Maggot, who were rumored as the heroes of the previous war and called by names like “the kingdom’s strongest pair”. She was looking forward to it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was told that there was a boy a year younger than her at the Cornelius House. When Ignis told her 「His personality is a bit difficult, so if possible please get along with him」, she was honestly feeling disappointed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It felt like the fantasy that she harbored as a child was breaking when she was told something like that about the son of the heroes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However that disappointment only lasted until she saw the training of Maggot and Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What’s wrong? You’re going to die if you rest you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『……Good grief, what an unbelievable mother ye are.』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The small Baldr spoke unknown words while dodging Maggot’s spear that was attacking him rapidly with paper-thin difference.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was high-speed thrusts that might lead to death if Baldr made even a single blunder──the name of Silver Light Maggot wasn’t just an exaggeration by any means.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     From what Teresa saw, the spear’s speed looked even faster than Mattis’s thrust.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And yet Baldr continued to dodge them all. Just how strong could he be to do that?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s right! Pulling back when facing a spear is just suicide! Know that your path to live is only forward!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『What’s with this impossible game! Give me some cheat!』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr gradually closed his distance with Maggot using only his small body that still couldn’t even use magic. The spear tip assaulted him without any mercy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so when he finally approached until a distance where it looked like he could leap into the opponent’s bosom, Maggot’s spear that was only thrusting until now swept horizontally and blew Baldr’s body away.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yosh, that’s enough for today!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot smiled in satisfaction. Baldr gave her a thumbs up even while his body was convulsing endlessly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The meaning of that pose was unknown but, Baldr’s face was that of a man among men who had achieved something. For some reason Teresa felt really irritated seeing that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the same time it also felt like her pride, which was growing a bit too big due to being praised as being more talented in martial arts than her little brother, was smashed to pieces.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was how Teresa became interested in Baldr. The chance to have a friend of the same generation who also excelled in martial arts arrived for her for the first time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Interesting. There is no way I can’t do it if Baldr can do it.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since then Teresa became Baldr’s friend. She might be his only friend that was also a fellow great noble.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although in contrast to Mattis’s expectation, in the end their relationship never crossed the category of being friends.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yaa Seyruun. You have become even prettier after we haven’t met for a while. You still haven’t decided to come to my place yet?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Thank you for your kind words, Teresa-sama. But, I will be young master Baldr’s maid forever.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How cold……then at the very least let’s enjoy ourselves together in a momentary tryst tonight.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please stop with the jokes……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun bowed with an elegant bearing, then she immediately hid behind Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was being used as a shield, but just this time he had to become Seyruun’s ally no matter what.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Teresa, can you stop trying to steal my lovely big sister?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Lovely──!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For an instant Seyruun’s expression almost broke into a happy grin, but she then hung her head down to hide her bright red face with her brown hair.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even then Teresa spread her hands widely and praised in exaggeration.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even your shy expression is so beautiful it will make the goddess ashamed. You are too good for the likes of Baldr!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In other words, this Teresa was a girl with an extremely strong lesbian disposition.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa smoothly stepped forward following her desire to embrace Seyruun. In response, Seyruun desperately dodged using Baldr as a shield.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A very stupid looking offense and defense unfolded with Baldr caught in between.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fufufu, that coldness of yours is also charming.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fuee……young master! Please save meee!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun shrank back and desperately ran away from Teresa’s skinship.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was the result of receiving sexual harassment that left a trauma in her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Mattis, she is still not cured?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I wonder if your son can take her in」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「As expected, I think it’s impossible as she is right now.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Mattis watched the children with a grave expression. Ignis smiled wryly to console him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wasn’t like there was no nobles with a strange hobby, but it was also a fact that a homosexual person was ridiculed by society just as much as the Cornelius house for taking a mercenary as a wife.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And more than that, if Teresa didn’t feel any attraction towards Baldr, then as a parent Mattis didn’t want to force her to marry.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Good grief, I’m jealous that you can raise Baldr-kun to be a splendid young man like that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although it was also unclear whether Baldr had really been raised well or not.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It would still be some time before Ignis and Mattis learned about Baldr’s hidden real nature.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 3
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The next morning after the unveiling, Baldr who was rounded up for training with his mother like usual also found Teresa wearing training clothes standing in high spirits beside him. There was also the figure of the old general Ramillies, who was emitting an overwhelming dignity and the tyrannical aura of a warrior, despite only wearing a blue shirt and a pair of gauntlets.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot’s face was as radiant as someone who had succeeded with her prank.  It made him feel like crying.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s shoulders slumped and he muttered.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Why is the general also here?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (He looks totally motivated. Rather, isn’t it like he is getting ready to kill someone?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Aa, General Ramillies was my former superior due to a bit of special circumstances. Aren’t you happy, you can practice with a general from the royal capital. I think you know already but, if your fight is too unsightly, the training will be a bit harder from tomorrow on, you understand?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll give it my all! Okaa-sama!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Yep, even now it’s already at the Extra Hard level, so if it becomes harder than that the only future for me will be death. I only barely survive day by day……am I really a young master of a noble house?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fight me first before that! Baldr!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa stepped into the training field with a determined spirit in her eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The black training outfit with good tailoring suited Teresa’s red hair.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If only her personality was ladylike then she would be a beautiful girl with many pursuers, and yet……Baldr couldn’t help but feeling it was unfortunate his old friend was like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Teresa, are you alright with using that wooden sword?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「My teacher said that I’m more suited to a sword rather than a spear.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Hmm, then perhaps I’ll take you on using a sword……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Muu, so cheeky even though you’re just Baldr!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It couldn’t be helped that the spear became the main weapon in the battlefield, but few nobles would stand at the frontline. Rather, the sword was considered to be a noble’s taste.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Naturally Baldr was trained in not just the spear but also the sword.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa looked displeased because it seemed like Baldr was going easy on her, but she didn’t complain any more than that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Are you two ready? Okay, start!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa went in to attack at the same time as Maggot’s words, as she believed victory would go to the one who made the first move.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She moved with sliding feet, but her forward rush was still accompanied with enough speed. And then she slashed down with her body weight put into her slash in order to compensate for a woman’s weaker physique.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa’s teacher telling her that she had talent with a sword wasn’t just empty praise.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ──But it was too clean.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In order to challenge a stronger opponent, one must take the opponent by surprise or at the very least use a combo that could unbalance the opponent.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If a fighter attacked without any tricks, they must have the awareness that it would be over for them if their attack was dodged. They had to put everything they have into that one attack.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A clean attack that was exactly like in training would only work against an equally strong opponent or a weaker opponent.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the end, Baldr who had survived Maggot’s hellish training on top of having Sanai’s memory could easily handle this attack without a problem.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr dodged Teresa’s slash by simply tilting his upper body. He rotated using his right foot as the axis and hit Teresa’s flank while he was turning around.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Guh!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although he held back, a hit from a wooden sword would still cause intense pain that made it hard to breathe.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However Teresa carefully took distance from him without looking shocked at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t you hold back on me!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Sorry.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though she was hit with a blow that might leave a bruise, far from writhing in pain, Teresa sensed that Baldr was holding back and got furious.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the same time she had to recognize that she wouldn’t even be able to scratch Baldr with mediocre attack.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even a slash that she thought was nicely done didn’t work. Teresa didn’t live so high above the clouds that she could still believe that they were equally strong.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She accepted reality, but even so she wanted to surpass Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Then how could she close the gap between their strength?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Throw away any defense. Throw away any combo too. Don’t worry about conserving stamina too. Don’t think about the consequences and attack just once, attack just once with all her strength poured into it!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa bent her body forward and slowly built up her strength by putting her weight behind her sword tip. Then like an arrow that was fired from a bow that had been drawn to its limit, she flew toward Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Sharp!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s eyes opened wide in amazement at the extremely swift thrust. It wasn’t like he was underestimating her, but she was like a completely different person from before with this attack.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was a feat that was achieved by the talent that Teresa was born with.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But, even so it was still inferior compared to Maggot’s attack that was like a death god’s.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And so, there was no way Baldr would helplessly get hit by it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa was convinced of her victory, believing that Baldr wouldn’t make it even if he started dodging now. The moment her lips warped into a grin, heaven and earth was overturned and she could see the ground above her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa’s eyes caught Baldr’s back when she came to herself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the moment of contact, Baldr grabbed the tip of Teresa’s wooden sword and made use of her forward momentum to throw her behind him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Gahah!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa who put all her strength into her attack just now was unable to do anything to reduce the impact when her back hit the ground.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Her lungs were pressured and the remaining air was squeezed out from her throat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even when she tried to stand up, the best she could do was clench her small hand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Match over!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot raised her arm to signal the end of the fight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr smiled wryly at Teresa who bit her lips in frustration while helping her to stand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although Teresa was feeling unhappy, she didn’t lose her cool and properly exchanged words of thanks with Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……I’ll win next time.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No, you have grown a lot stronger. I’m surprised.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Certainly her swordsmanship was really sharp and impressed Baldr. It could be seen that she had managed to run across a really excellent teacher.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was impossible for a noble lady like Teresa who was cherished by her parents to go through deadly training like Baldr. Taking that into consideration, Teresa’s battle strength was more than high enough.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Cheeky.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa pouted and looked aside.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no doubt that Baldr went easy on her, but in the past she wouldn’t even be able to notice that. Now she had reached a level where she was able to at last perceive the difference in strength between them.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Teresa didn’t want to recognize that honestly. It was because Teresa who knew the mentally unstable Baldr in his childhood days considered herself as his big sister.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……How’s that?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Honestly, I wouldn’t believe it if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes. 」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot and Ramillies had grasped the difference between the two even more accurately than Teresa.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa had increased her physical capability using magic in the fight just now. In contrast Baldr won overwhelmingly against Teresa using only his base physical ability.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies didn’t know whether he would be able to find anyone who could do the same thing even if he searched within the knight order. That was just how sharp Baldr’s movement was.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Gufufu……」 A stifled laughter leaked out from Ramillies’s throat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Interesting. What a fortuitous encounter with an interesting talent.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In Ramillies’s old bones, his blood was starting to seethe hotly just like in the past.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Now then, because I too am not as skilled as Maggot-dono in using a spear, I’ll use a sword to face you. Is that alright with you, Baldr-dono?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please go easy on me……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot looked cheerful at a glance, but her smile didn’t reach her eyes at all. After confirming that, Baldr readied his sword while feeling cold sweat trickling down his back.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Good grief……this grandpa isn’t a joke at all.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It felt like there was a sword aura that stabbed into his skin just from Ramillies pointing his sword toward him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies had already reached the old age of sixty years old, but his muscle that was trained like steel didn’t look like they had emaciated at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     While his body was a bit short, the flesh had been thoroughly tempered without exception. Added with battlefield instinct that was based on his abundant experiences enabled Ramillies to keep his status as a first rate warrior.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two of them held their sword in front of them and pointed their respective sword tip toward each other’s eyes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     By doing that it made it hard to grasp the sword’s distance using sight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was the basic when fighting using a sword.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Fuh!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Without any preliminary motion from his shoulders and elbows, Ramilliess sword that looked like a dot from Baldr’s perspective suddenly swelled up──the instant he perceived that, the sword was already approaching right in front of Baldr’s face.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr tilted his head to dodge the trust using mostly his instinct.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Hou, so he dodged this too without magic.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies was impressed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Whether using sword or spear, in a one-on-one duel there were various techniques to not allow the opponent to grasp the distance between the two fighters. This wasn’t just using pure technique, but also included predicting each other’s thought. Experience was important for it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the first place instinct wasn’t thought. It was reflex that was imprinted deeply upon the subconscious mind to derive an answer from the person’s vault of experience.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seeing Baldr able to do that in his age made Ramillies felt more sympathy for him rather than surprise.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (……The Silver Light is really merciless even against her own son, who’s still this small……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Baldr who was still eleven years old to have that much dueling experience seemed too extreme, even from the perspective of Ramillies who was also a martial artist.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However it went without saying that in reality Sanai’s influence played a large part in it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ho ho……is it alright for me to be serious if it’s like this?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Please spare me, I’m quite serious here.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Don’t worry, it’s not really a big deal even if an old man like me get serious.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies said that while launching an attack at Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was an agile movement that didn’t suit his wide body which gave a sluggish impression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He attacked Baldr mercilessly from up, down, left, and right with a speed that couldn’t be followed with sight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr whose muscle strength should be overwhelmingly inferior dodged or parried all of those attacks. He completely protected his body from getting hit.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then Baldr stepped onto Ramillies’s bosom, but Ramillies’s momentum didn’t slow down at all even then. With his short stature, point-blank range wasn’t a distance that he was weak at by any means.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Shit-! I blundered!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     With their difference in stature, Baldr thought that he wouldn’t be able to find any prospect of victory other than with close combat, but it was unexpected for him that Ramillies wasn’t bothered at all against that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He thought that even if he was unable to defeat Ramillies easily, he would be able to decrease the number of his attacks somewhat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At this point Baldr’s evasion had already been mostly left to just his instinct. He wouldn’t make it if he took the time to think before dealing with the attacks.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then he focused on forming a plan to overcome this unfavorable situation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (General doesn’t use magic to strengthen his body. Most likely he still won’t use it even if I strengthened my body. Even so he will use it without hesitation if it gets dangerous for him. If that happens then it’ll be over for me with the difference in our physical and magical ability.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In other words, he would have to bring down Ramillies with one attack while he was still letting his guard down.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was no other way for him to escape Maggot’s hellish training other than that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Amazing……Baldr has grown this strong……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr continued to endure the slashes that could send her flying with just one of them. He was clearly standing on a different stage than her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although she didn’t want to, she had to recognize that fact.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「My son has trained a lot longer after all……sorry to say this to you Teresa-chan, but I won’t be able to show my face if you can catch up to Baldr that easily.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot also acknowledged Teresa’s talent, but Maggot’s training wasn’t so lenient that it could be surpassed by her just because she had met a somewhat capable teacher.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since Baldr was the student, he was able to endure the training.. But normally, nine out of ten, even a grown up would have either their body or mind breaking first if they underwent such harsh training.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Setting aside whether it was alright for a mother to force her son to undergo such training; even though she felt bad for Teresa who considered Baldr as her rival since she was a child, Maggot had no intention of allowing her to catch up to Baldr even in the future.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Teresa smiled fearlessly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No, it’ll be even more worth it to defeat him if he’s this strong.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Teresa knew a truth about Baldr that most likely nobody knew about except the people of Cornelius House.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although the very young Baldr possessed absurd strength, he was a timid boy who was strangely scared in interacting with other people.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wasn’t like that anymore now, but when his personality was still unstable, he was swung around by the memories of his past lives as though he was scared of the world itself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The emotion that Teresa, who liked the same sex, harbored for Baldr at that time might be the desire to protect, but at this point in time it was a fact that nobody knew, not even Teresa herself..
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Tsk!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The wooden sword that was gradually becoming impossible for Baldr to handle was starting to leave red abrasions on his skin.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The exchange of sword fighting that didn’t allow even an instant of opening was robbing Baldr’s stamina more than expected.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr who wanted to observe Ramillies’s habit for a bit more couldn’t hide his anxiety.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Geez……he isn’t even allowing me to slowly wait for a chance.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The situation would keep worsening for him at this rate.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Resolving himself, Baldr circulated magic in his body.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Body strengthening──it was a powerful magic with the highest versatility that was the basis for any warrior.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot’s strength was using this body strengthening to specialize in speed. It gave her the nickname “Silver Light”.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Hmm. Splendid magic execution but……how much of the Silver Light’s skill he has inherited now?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies wasn’t letting his guard down at all but, he still had the leeway to measure Baldr’s capability.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s martial skill that could make Ramillies’s blood boil even though he was still eleven years old was nothing short of amazing, but even so it still wasn’t enough to make Ramillies use body strengthening himself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, if Baldr’s speed could approach the level of Maggot, then as expected even Ramillies would find it hard to endure without using strengthening himself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he was forced to use body strengthening, then Ramillies would consider it as Baldr’s victory at that point.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Now then my son, what kind of struggle you are going to show.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot watched the two with her full focus.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was Maggot’s prided son, but he wasn’t her successor by all means.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr had inherited from Sanai the spear and sword technique from the Warring States period along with jujitsu that was used with bare hands. There was also Baldr’s way of using magic that followed a different concept from the humans of this world.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It could only be called as Baldr-style already.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This fight would become interesting because Ramillies didn’t know anything about that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot watched with enjoyment. Her eyes narrowed seeing Baldr’s face that turned manly. He was going to bare his fang even while sweating like a waterfall.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「SERYAAAAAAAAAAA!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr roared.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He screamed as though to say that he was going to attack now, but it was a useful method to not let oneself feel overwhelmed by the opponent in a fight to the death.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Sanai’s memory knew very well about that effect.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Ramillies who was exposed to that voice had gone past being shocked and straight into feeling uneasy from Baldr’s loud fighting spirit that resounded from the bottom of his stomach.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was undoubtedly the yell of someone who was acquainted with the battlefield.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It didn’t matter whether they would live or die, only the thought of slaughtering the enemy filled their mind──only a warrior with such resolve could make this roar that overwhelmed the enemy, a warrior who had transformed itself into a walking corpse for the sake of battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Regardless of their actual skill, this kind of soldier was formidable and couldn’t be underestimated. Ramillies was aware of that from his experiences.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (To think I’ll be reminded of the battlefield from facing a child like this.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr deeply lowered his body like a four-legged beast that was going to leap toward its prey.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was just like Teresa before this. Ramillies sensed that Baldr was going to release a single attack with all his strength.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies took his stance vigilantly. Baldr’s strength that was accumulated until the limit exploded and he flew very low on the ground toward Ramillies with a shocking speed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was the basic to slash at the central part of the body for the weapon called the sword. The opponent was also expecting that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was why at the end of Edo era, a sword technique that slashed at the shin like Ryuugou-style displayed its might in real battle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, it didn’t matter how difficult this slash was to deal with, for Ramillies this attack looked too upfront.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (It’s a really good attack but……no, I guess it’s already terrifying enough for an eleven year old child to be able to learn this kind of technique?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There weren’t many knights who could do this kind of attack even among Ramillies’s subordinates. At the very least there weren’t even five such people as far as Ramillies knew.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he considered Baldr’s future growth, he could only say that Baldr’s talent left him with vague fears inside him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But as expected, it was an overestimation to consider him a talent that surpassed Maggot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies felt just a touch of disappointment, it was so small that it wasn’t even a ten thousandth of his feeling. With such a feeling he folded his elbow and easily knocked down Baldr’s sword that was creeping on the ground.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In that instant, Ramillies’s dominant foot, his right foot, felt like it was sucked into the ground. He couldn’t help but panic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Damn it! Earth magic, huh!?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr slashed while at the same time he activated a different magic that he camouflaged as body strengthening.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If this was a magic that could be easily recognized visually like a flame or water bullet, Ramillies would be able to easily dispel it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was why Baldr used his sword as a medium to activate magic that caused the ground to cave in, which was hard to notice.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Certainly, if it was just a magic to convert the ground under Ramillies’s right foot into soft sand, it was possible to activate it with a single word chant.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies immediately tried to recover his balance with his left foot, but Baldr was already making use of the momentum when his sword was knocked away to half-rotate while extending his small arm.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies was unable to react to this because his sword was swung in the opposite direction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even if he tried to dodge he wouldn’t make it in time with his body weight currently placed on his left foot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s arm twined around his opponent’s left knee and he put his whole weight into it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Jujitsu Hizakarame Knee Entangling──it was an unarmed fighting skill for real battle that was developed in the Warring States period to hold down the opponent in order to take their neck.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the Warring States period it was easy for the battle to become a melee, and there one had to take the enemy’s head as the proof of their achievement. Sanai who survived such an era was naturally an expert with that technique.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies too might be able to recover his balance if he seriously strengthened his body with magic, but he felt that it would be shameful for him to struggle at this point.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies’s waist that was thick like a large tree’s trunk shook unsteadily and he fell down face up along with a heavy thud.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Haha! I’m beaten, I’m beaten! To think you’re this talented!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No, I’m unable to make the general even use body strengthening. I’m still inexperienced.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The battle ended and the two exchanged words.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr just barely succeeded in launching his surprise attack, but it surely wouldn’t work  the second time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although the fact that Baldr realized that heightened Ramillies’s evaluation toward Baldr even more.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I never imagined using earth magic to cave the ground like that. I’m the one who is lacking in my learning.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies was ashamed that without him knowing it he was already imprisoned within preconception.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Magic was certainly convenient, but the era where magicians using balls of fire or ice spears and were the stars of the battlefield was nothing more than a story of the past.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The cause of that was, first, magic was something that distorted the principle of the world. Magic would weaken considerably the further away it got from its caster.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Released type magic that was fired from the caster’s hand would decay in proportion to its distance from the caster. So a magician had to possess considerably strong magic power to be useful in the battlefield.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Naturally the number of such magicians was terribly limited.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The other reason was the rapid popularization of Cancellation Magic that could neutralize the effect of magic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because it was a spell to return the distorted principle of the world back to normal, it had good cost performance. It was said that a single unit of magic power could cancel a magic that possessed three to five units of magic power.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore Cancel was just a rudimentary spell. So even a common soldier with weak magic power could easily use it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Due to those reasons, flashy attack magic became obsolete in the blink of an eye.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rising in its place was internal strengthening magic, with body strengthening on the top of the list.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Humans were born possessing magic power to a greater or lesser degree. By circulating the magic power inside their body, it would function to block magic power intervention from outside and protect the body. This internal strengthening magic had the trait of being difficult for Cancel to affect, so this magic was popularized rapidly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Learning the magic of body strengthening was essential even in the kingdom’s knight order. The majority of their effort was spent learning how to quickly apply the magic and which part of their body they could strengthen.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot who was nicknamed Silver Light was because she was an unparalleled genius in efficiently strengthening her reflexes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, to strengthen the reflexes like this, it was absolutely necessary for the person to possess an extraordinary sense.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The case of people poorly strengthening their nerve’s transmission system and then being unable to process the result, which led to half of their body being paralyzed, wasn’t a rare story.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because of that most soldiers only strengthened their physical strength and stamina before calling it quits.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At present release type magic was only used by those with outstanding talent like the royal court magician for example. Other than that this type of magic was only used for small things in daily life simply due to its convenience.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But the way Baldr used his magic was something that could urge the revival of such release type magic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No one had taken another look at this kind of magic because it couldn’t be used for offense, but in reality it could be said that the possibility for this kind of use was infinite.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although an excellent sense like Baldr would be needed to master that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies was disappointed. He had to research this from the beginning first in order to popularize it within the army.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You’re saved by the skin of your teeth, Baldr.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Thank you very much! Okaa-sama!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I-I’m saved……in the truest sense.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr wanted to immediately sink down on the ground to relax, but he just barely endured it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He managed to get through the fight without exposing anything unsightly, so it seemed he was able to secure his life to keep seeing the sun since tomorrow onward too.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot looked at Baldr with a narrowed gaze. She only looked like she was threatening Baldr, but actually she was narrowing her eyes with fondness of Baldr’s growth.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Ramillies who knew Maggot very well was completely not suspecting that she had such doting thoughts like that. It must be the fault of her daily behavior.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「But you’re still inadequate. It’s worthy of praise that you manage to take your opponent’s knee, but if you have reached that far then aim for his jewels as well.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     ……It was the fault of her daily behavior, without a doubt.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      Even so,
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies thought.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At first he could accept some parts of what happened by thinking
    </span>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      Well, that’s because he is Maggot’s son after all
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     , but there were too many parts that couldn’t be explained with just that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That yell of fighting spirit that was directed toward an opponent who held overwhelming advantage, it was the yell of someone familiar with the battlefield.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was already surprising enough that Baldr had experience of killing humans, but it was unthinkable for him to have experience in the battlefield.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No, it was possible for Maggot to disguise herself and participate in a small skirmish at the border together with her son. Such a possibility couldn’t be denied but……as expected Ramillies wanted to believe that Maggot wasn’t that irrational.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then that magic……it was obviously a different technique from the acceleration magic that Maggot mastered.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If that magic was something that Baldr thought up by himself, then Baldr’s talent certainly had to be said as something that surpassed Maggot.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The time right now was peaceful even if it was an unstable one, so there might not be anything that would come of it, but if war broke out again, Baldr wouldn’t just stop with Cornelius House, he might become an existence that controlled the fate of the kingdom.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ramillies sighed. At the same time he couldn’t help but think about Baldr’s future.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was also feeling envy toward Maggot who was able to train this boy who was like an unpolished gem every day.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For a martial artist, being able to raise a talented disciple was a pleasure that was as sweet as encountering a worthy enemy.

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 4
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Oka Masaharu was different from Sanai. He was a commoner who was born in the extremely normal family of a salaryman in modern Japan.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, he was infected by chuunibyou, a sickness that was a characteristic of a youth in their puberty. He was obsessed with a particular hobby that was a bit out of the norm.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Of all things, he liked to seriously consider the case study if he was ever reincarnated.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Due to some kind of fate, he was reincarnated to this world. Perhaps it was destiny in a sense.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Just when he thought that he got involved with a traffic accident, the next moment a good looking pair of husband and wife were peering onto him while talking in language that he didn’t know.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Inside his mind was a whirlwind of complicated feelings like bewilderment and disappointment because all his hard work for the university entrance exam went to waste, but the next emotion that he harbored was joy.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because no matter how he got here, it was a reincarnation that he always dreamed of.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps after this there would be the development of 『Oka Masaharu’s heroic fantasy, the legend of the strongest protagonist』. However, such expectation was cruelly betrayed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What differed from his expectation was that other than Masaharu’s memory, there was also the personality of Sanai with him. And then Baldr himself had also possessed his own ego.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Thinking back now, it was only because Baldr was still a toddler whose ego hadn’t fully formed that his brain could adapt to this abnormal situation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The information amount of three lives was immense. To experience and assimilate all of it in chronological order was clearly too heavy of a burden for the human brain.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The three personalities could settle down with each other, albeit imperfectly, was in large thanks to Sanai who refrained from butting in while Baldr was still a toddler with little experience.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Masaharu himself, though he needed a long time before he finally came to accept that the main character of this tale wasn’t him, eventually accepted walking the path of coexistence with Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a painful decision, even so compared to the happiness of living in another world it was nothing at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Yes, if he could just live then──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『I-it’s going to break! My arm will break if it bends that way! Don’t get on my back right nowwwwwwwww!』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Is it just my imagination that it feels like you still have some leeway?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     What waited for the three who began to live in coexistence was an insane training that would bring death if they let their guard down for even an instant. Even if they managed to escape death, heavy injury like broken bones was commonplace.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No, perhaps Maggot herself believed that she had held back by a lot, even then her opponent was still a six year old kid.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore Masaharu was just a normal high school student. Maggot’s training was something irrational for him, or rather it was already just a torture.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『Full marathon with a spear poking at the back is just crazyyyyyyyy!!』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Come on, come on! A large hole is going to open in your back if your speed drops even just for a bit you know!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     『No more! What kind of mother are you–!』
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Such desperate training resulted in the memories of Baldr and Masaharu and Sanai fuse with Baldr as the main body while each personality still greatly influenced each other.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Maggot’s training was too harsh, so the influence that Sanai gave Baldr was relatively bigger, but it didn’t mean that Masaharu’s influence was small.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rather, if the current Baldr’s objective was considered, it might be possible that his influence was stronger than Sanai.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps it should be said as something common for a young man who was ill from chuunibyou. Masaharu was well-versed with the domestic affairs cheat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>

   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 5
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The responses are favorable. But it’s already exposed how that sugar isn’t created from sugarcane ya know? Even if we keep it a secret, it won’t last that long……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina who returned from the capital was showing a happy smile with her elegant lips.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The sugar that Baldr entrusted to her was sold at a higher price than she expected.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Thanks to that, the stock of Savaran Company also greatly increased. Even in the royal capital, there were few merchants that could handle luxury items for nobles like sugar.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     How was a small company located in a remote region in the kingdom like the Cornelius Territory able to procure sugar? The sly old foxes in the big company who threw around their weight in the royal capital’s merchant commerce guild were already starting to investigate.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I knew that would happen from the start. I just need to buy some time.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ve finished buying the land. Around five hectare (50.000 square meters) of barren lands that are neglected.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No no, five hectare is too much……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She was really motivated. In Baldr’s plan, he planned to start with just one hectare that he would procure through his acquaintance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Five hectare was as spacious as the Tokyo Dome. It was an extraordinary size for Cornelius Territory with its few farmlands.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Well, ya can just think of it as my prior investment.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina snorted without looking guilty at the slightest. With just the funds that Baldr entrusted to her, it would be just like an extra earning for her company no matter how much she got from the sugar’s sale.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Trade wasn’t just a matter of accumulating money. Investing to expand the business’s scale was crucial. A capable merchant like Selina knew that very well.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then she had conceded to Baldr before with the percentage of the profit, so she thought that it was only appropriate that there was this much benefit for her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina would lose money if this business failed, but when she thought of the amount of  estimated profit, that risk couldn’t become a reason for her to hesitate in investing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Then, I wonder how much I can receive from Selina’s earning?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     With the wide difference of the investment capital between them, it couldn’t be helped that the majority of the profit was grasped by Selina. Savaran Company acquiring the ability and evaluation that brought them to the level of a big company wouldn’t be a bad deal for Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But, no matter how close he was to Selina, he didn’t have the slightest intention to let her have a free ride on his business plan.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When it came to money, it was better to have as much of it as possible, even if it were just a single coin more. That was Baldr’s belief.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Let’s see……how about thirty percent of the whole profit for ya? Even with that my profit should increase dramatically compared to before.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Well, I’m not taking any risk losing money here, so I guess that amount is appropriate? I’m not going to complain at all if you add the fluffing right of your ears to it though.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Th-that’s a no! I only let ya that one time because of the special occasion!! Ya can touch my ears only when I permit it!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina’s face instantly turned red and both her hands pressed on her dog ears that stood up tensely in alert.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although her tail could still be seen wagging around energetically. It might be representing Selina’s unconscious desire of wanting to be petted.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「──If the young master teases the president too much, I’ll seriously ask the young master to take her as your wife, you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m sorry. My tongue slipped.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Rorona’s calm scolding made Baldr apologize reflexively.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He knew from being acquainted with her for these two years that she wasn’t the type to joke at all.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina’s expression turned a bit sullen seeing Baldr apologizing without any hesitation, but it was absolutely impossible to make a boy who was still eleven years old imagine the graveyard of life, so Baldr hoped she would understand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「And, we have procured gold bullion as cheaply as possible, but what is the young master going to do with it?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Gold bullion was a gold ingot that hadn’t been processed. It didn’t have any added value from being processed, so compared to a gold coin or gold works, it could be bought cheaply.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even then, gold was precious even in this world. It wasn’t something that could be purchased that cheaply.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I also bought some old metal works that were priced dirt cheap. Ya aren’t planning to normally create some gold works,right?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Certainly, most beautiful gold works would fetch a great price.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However such things only became viable for the first time when there were three factors. A wealthy noble as a customer, skilled craftsman with wonderful artistic sense, and then the status of the company that let the customer have faith in the product.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter how novel the gold works that Baldr could create, it wouldn’t sell at all just at that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If the price was cheap then the number of people who would want to buy it would be as numerous as the stars, but then they wouldn’t earn any profit at all like that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina didn’t suspect at all that Baldr would do something stupid like that. Surely he had some other method.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「No, I’m just going to make some normal works. Though it’ll be a bit different from what Selina thought.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Eeeh?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina became uneasy, wondering whether she was trusting Baldr too much. Though if Rorona was asked, she would say that Selina was already trusting Baldr too much since a long time ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, Selina noticed how excited Baldr’s eyes were. She realized that he was just teasing her and scowled with a pout.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ya really are wicked huh, Baldr. Do ya enjoy making fun of a cute girl like me that much?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s really fun seeing the always unruffled Selina looking flustered, you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uuu……you really are wicked, just as I thought.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Let me inform in advance, if I judge that our president won’t be able to become a wife anymore, I’ll have young master take her as your wife at any cost.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Scary! Rorona-san is scary—!!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (E-even though this is really fun, I’ll need to risk my life from now on when teasing Selina huh……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Under Rorona’s pressure, Baldr nervously straightened his back as though he had swallowed a rod.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Au au……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Meanwhile Selina seemed to imagine her relationship with Baldr in the future. She shook her head with a red face while writhing around.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina would be undaunted even when facing nobles in business dealings, but this innocence. Just who was she taking after……Rorona pondered.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Even though normally she is riddled with openings, when push comes to shove she’ll show an outstanding decisiveness……as I thought, perhaps it’s due to her father’s blood in her.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That meant there was a risk of Selina making a blunder when it was crucial. That was frightening, so Rorona nodded deeply in her heart that she had to pay attention as Selina’s subordinate.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Awkwardness filled the room for a while.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Then Baldr cleared his throat while pulling himself together. He took out a hair ornament from his pocket.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I asked this to be made in a workshop as a sample……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a hair ornament with a design that was fairly splendid even in Selina’s observation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was an ornament in the shape of a windflower. The workmanship itself gave an ordinary impression, but the honeybee decoration that looked like it was attracted to the flower became a wonderful accent in the design.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     One could catch a glimpse that a skilful craftsman must have been pouring his heart and soul into this exquisite creation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, even more shocking than that was how this ornament was created from gold.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This kind of handiwork……just how expensive it is?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina asked with a gulp.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Rorona who rarely changed her expression was at a loss of words with her eyes wide open.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a precious moment that he would want to preserve for eternity if only he had a camera.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, it was only natural for them to react like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That delicate and elegant molding and the shine of what was undoubtedly gold must be worth more than a hundred gold coins in Selina’s assessment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No, if it was a noble with a taste for this kind of thing then they might even pay 200 gold coins for it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a high-class item that was almost impossible to be found in a remote region like the Cornelius territory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It doesn’t even cost half a gold coin you know?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What did ya say!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No no, that’s just impossible. Even if she only considered the material for it, the cost wouldn’t go lower than ten gold coins.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The price that Baldr spoke out was so out of common sense that she doubted his sanity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This is just gold plating after all.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Plating?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yep, gold plating. The gold is only on the surface while the inside is bronze.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Even then, there’s no way that it only cost half a gold coin!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The plating method that was practiced by very few people within the kingdom at present was done by melting gold with mercury, coating an object with the melted gold, and then drying the object with fire to evaporate the mercury, leaving only the gold behind.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This method had the advantage of reducing the amount of gold necessary, but it needed a lot of effort and time along with skill to practice it. As a result, the necessary expense wasn’t particularly cheaper than just using gold completely. To be honest, there wasn’t much merit in this method.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was a minor technique. Even Selina wouldn’t know it if she wasn’t a merchant.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr watched Selina with an expression that looked delighted from the bottom of his heart. Then he threw an even bigger bomb into the conversation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「By the way, anyone can easily make this thing.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Just as he anticipated, the two beauties who were rich in life experience exposed their rare shocked expressions in front of Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After that the two of them shyly mended their expression and hurriedly returned to their company in order to plan the new marketing for the plating artwork.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though they were already having their hands full with things like arranging manpower for the sugar production, its storage destination, circulation to the market, etc., now there was this new talk of plating artwork.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However their instinct as merchant told them that they shouldn’t let go of this chance no matter what.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Because this plating artwork commodity had the chance to cut open a market among the middle level nobles and wealthy commoners who couldn’t buy high grade luxury items until now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Savaran Company, which was a prominent business that in the end still originated from just a peddler, this product would give them the status that they desperately wanted.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It didn’t matter how difficult the leadership that was demanded from them for this, they wouldn’t be a merchant if their soul wasn’t ablaze here.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (As I thought, I should have him take the president as his wife even if I have to do it forcibly……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    Selina’s ambition was burning and she yelled toward the sky while being utterly ignorant to the scheming of her
    <ruby>
     confidant
     <rt>
      Rorona
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    「Yosshaa, I’m gonna do ittttt! Just watch me! Pops, mom!」
   </p>
   <p>
    If she was able to secure this product, don’t mention the Cornelius territory, even being a leading company in the whole kingdom wouldn’t be just a dream.
   </p>
   <p>
    The maiden who couldn’t help but be sensitive towards her social position when thinking about the
    <ruby>
     future
     <rt>
      marriage
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    had completely inherited the blood of a determined merchant, as expected.
   </p>
   <p>
    .
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 6
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The workshop that was entrusted with the plating artwork by Baldr was located in a place about twenty minutes walking distance from the sugar beet farm in the outskirts.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The signboard that had the large letters 『Gothe Workshop』written clumsily upon it mysteriously suited this cozy workshop.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Perhaps it could be said as appropriate for this workshop, which belonged to a skilled craftsman who did good work despite his insignificant establishment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Boss Gothe, how are you doing?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ooh, young lord. Well, right now I’ve finally finished around twenty of them.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I told you there’s no need to call me young lord…….」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    It felt uncomfortable because when he called him “
    <ruby>
     young lord
     <rt>
      wakatono
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    ”, it sounded similar to “
    <ruby>
     stupid lord
     <rt>
      bakatono
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    ”.
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At first this man acted haughtily towards him and called him “boy”, but then he would only talk to him with polite language like this after he showed him the plating method.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It seemed that it was because of the code about pecking order in the world of craftsmen.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Gothe was Tyros’s big brother. He was still 33 years old.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It wasn’t just for show for him to have his own workshop at this young age. He was a famous person locally for his shapely craftsmanship that was overflowing with his individuality.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When Baldr caught sight of Gothe’s metal craftsmanship in a tool shop, he secretly investigated his identity and learned that he was Tyros’s relative. Then he asked Tyros to introduce him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However Gothe scoffed and sharply rebuked Baldr when he came with a request for him.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Listen boy. I’m not gonna make anything other than what I want to make!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I don’t intend to force you to create anything, boss. But could you first take a look at this」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Gothe wasn’t just skilled, Baldr learned from Tyros that he was also a craftsman with an extremely strong sense of curiosity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At his age normally Gothe would still be an apprentice, but he had become independent like this because of his clash against his conservative master due to his insatiable curiosity and ambition to improve himself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr judged that he had obtained Gothe’s wordless agreement and put a vase around 30 cm wide in front of Gothe.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「What? This thing……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Well, it’s a power source for a certain technology.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Power source?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Gothe tilted his head in puzzlement.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In this world, when talking about power source it would mainly be about a water wheel or windmill, or rarely it would be about a mechanism using a magic tool.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Gothe couldn’t even imagine what a small vase like this would power up.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「And, if you connect the vase’s electrode with this tray using a copper wire……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr poured acidic liquid on the metal tray and took the copper wire that was extending from the vase.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then, he crushed a golden button that he received as a present into a small gold plate. He connected the copper wire to it and then soaked the gold into the liquid.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oi oi, boy. Just where did you get that gold from?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Gothe himself possessed some gold as a craftsman for the sake of his work, but it was strange for a kid this little to have gold.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was only now that Gothe finally noticed the clothes and shoes that Baldr were wearing were too high quality for a commoner.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (……Don’t tell me he’s a noble? No, there’s no reason for a noble to come to my workshop to show his stuff.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「And then put this bronze work of boss here──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Oi! That’s my work that I sold wholesale to Messina’s place!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s a really good work. It looks exactly like what I imagined.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was an ornament of a large windflower with adorable honeybees gathering on the flower petals. But the coloring was regrettably bad.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Some things couldn’t be helped. Gothe was a craftsman, not a painter.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was often said that sometimes an owner of outstanding talent would be lacking another talent. Gothe’s case was exactly like that. His talent in coloring was insufficient.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Wait for a while just like this.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Just what’re you doing? Hm, this is……why is it bubbling? What’s more, it’s hot?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Gothe froze with wide eyes at the scene that overturned his common sense from its foundation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He once heard that there was an eccentric craftsman at the royal capital who used magic in his craft, but even an amateur like Gothe knew that what Baldr was using wasn’t magic.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But, he couldn’t understand what this young boy was using when he wasn’t even using his hands or fire.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Interesting. When was the last time my heart was beating so hard like this?)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The vase that Baldr prepared was a primitive battery.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This vase thing was discovered as a relic in Iraq’s capital, Baghdad. Masaharu learned from a television broadcast that this thing was called Baghdad’s battery and treated as an OOPart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Its construction was simple. You put a copper cylinder inside the vase, then put an iron rod inside the cylinder. And then the inside of the cylinder was filled with electrolytes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was something that could be created without trouble even in this world without a culture of science.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Masaharu’s chuuni heart was tickled seeing a TV program talking about urban legends of electricity already existing in the BC era and so he remembered it, but it was a secret.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the experiment that Germany’s scientists carried out, this vase battery could stably provide 2 volts of electricity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was easy to do plating as long as there was electricity. It seemed there was a possibility that the necklace plated with gold that was discovered in Egypt was created with this method.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In reality, when Masaharu was still alive, he once succeeded experimenting with plating the bolt of his beloved ZZR motorcycle.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He used a normal battery at that time, but because the principle was the same, Baldr was able to look forward to the result without feeling too worked up.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     And then around 30 minutes later.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The work was pulled up in front of Gothe who was watching with held breath.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Wait, WHAT THE HELL IS THISSSSSSSS!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It couldn’t be helped that Gothe was shocked.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The windflower that was lacking any grace due to its garish coloring was now adorned with a devilish brilliance from the gold luster. It was emitting a radiant glitter.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Do you want to try it?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Gothe unhesitatingly nodded his head continuously like a broken doll at Baldr’s offer.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since then Gothe wouldn’t stop acting politely towards Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For Gothe who couldn’t complete something that satisfied himself despite saying that he would only make what he wanted, Baldr’s existence was like a messiah.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「This is the raw gold.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr spoke to Gothe who was reminiscing about their first meeting.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Is it alright for me to hold this much?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I might order more depending on the amount of your works.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Gothe gratefully accepted the gold. Then Baldr replied to him while recalling Selina’s reaction before this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If he requested them, Savaran Company would undoubtedly invest gold into this venture.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Heheh, I’m really feeling blessed as a craftsman to be in this position.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Gothe rubbed his nose happily and pointed at several of his completed works.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll finish fifty of them somehow in this month.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Yep, that many will be enough.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     They weren’t producing this for the common people, so there was no need to produce so many for now.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so if these products were sold…….
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That ambition, to completely cover the surface of Baldr’s children room──it had the space of easily more than twelve tatami though──with several thousands of gold coins would become possible.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr broke out laughing ‘guhehe’ with his drool almost spilling out when he imagined that scenery.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr was starting to think that if such a scene really became possible, he would be unable to restrain himself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (……G-gold coins. My gold coinsss!!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 7
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Recently, Baldr was hiding something important from me.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun felt a feeling of desolation like a cold wintry wind raging inside her chest just from thinking that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun also noticed that her feelings couldn’t be explained with just her position as a maid serving her master.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She thought that Baldr had changed to a surprising degree within these several years.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He was emotionally unstable when they first met five years ago. He couldn’t even communicate satisfactorily at that time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, now he might be even bolder than his father Ignis at times, while his martial arts skill had improved to the point that even his mother Maggot couldn’t take him on as easily as before.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     His reputation was also excellent after the evening party the other day. There was no doubt that he would become an excellent prospect for the nobles everywhere to bring up marriage talks about from here on.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In comparison to that, how about herself?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun’s finger played with the hair that she was proud of, which she had continued to grow up until her waist since about three years ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr called her cute, but somewhere inside there was a part of her that thought her looks were mediocre as expected when compared to Maggot or the head maid Emma.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun’s father Cyril(セロ) was a vassal from a family that had served the Cornelius House for generations. He was a knight that Ignis trusted deeply and entrusted with the post as the current commanding officer of Hohen(ホーエン) Fortress at the border.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     According to what she heard, her father and Ignis were also raised as childhood friends. He said that in life it was really important to have a friend one could be frank with.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, there was a definite difference between Cyril and Ignis, and Seyruun and Baldr.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     That was how Baldr was a male and Seyruun was a female.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun’s fourteenth birthday would arrive soon. One of the reasons she couldn’t help but feel conscious of this matter was also because her older coworker Mathilda was teasing her recently.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「How’s it going? Is it going well between you and the young master?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……For some reason when I heard your words, it sounds like something really impure.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「You’re still acting innocent……Seyruun, you will grow into a woman soon, and the young master is also maturing early, so surely there is also that kind of development between you two isn’t it?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Wha-!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun turned red up until her neck.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the same time she noticed that Mathilda’s gaze was moving between her breasts and butts that finally had been growing bigger lately. She covered her breasts with both her hands as though she was hugging herself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She didn’t know about other nobles, but Cornelius House was extremely gentlemanly towards women. She had no immunity against this kind of flagrant staring.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「H~~~m, perhaps it’s still too early for Seyruun just as I thought.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Young master would never stare at me with those kinds of impure eyes!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Perhaps that’s the case right now. But what about tomorrow? Next year? Do you think that the young master won’t recognize you as a member of the opposite sex forever? He is the son of that Ignis-sama. He’ll grow into an adult quickly!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Uuu–!!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis was mentioned as an example here, which caused even Seyruun to be at a loss for words right away.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Before he married Maggot, what would come to mind when Ignis’s name was mentioned was a handsome and single count who had a reputation as a philanderer with many beautiful women.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Though right now it was impossible to even imagine him cheating (physically).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The possibility of his son Baldr laying his hands on multiple women as he grew up might be high instead.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Besides, thinking normally aren’t you obviously a concubine candidate already? I’m jealous……even I might be chosen as young master’s partner if only I was born five years later and our age matched each other……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「EEEEEEEEEEEEEEH!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Concubine? Me as a concubine? Not a childhood friend? Not a big sister? Even though the young master is always calling me Sey-nee, Sey-nee, so
    </span>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight:400;">
      there’s just no way…….
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ee? Could it be that you weren’t aware? Fragol House and Dhaka House in the neighboring territory are also taking in a childhood friend as a concubine to be the coordinator of the lord’s mistresses. It’s an old trick for nobles to leave the role of managing their women within the house to their trusted childhood friend.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「S-such a thing……I……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Mathilda’s words were like a bolt out of the blue. Seyruun’s mind became blank. She couldn’t imagine herself becoming Baldr’s wife.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Ignis-sama is kind so he surely won’t force you, but your parents must be having expectations. After all this kind of attractive chance is something that only a select few people can get.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Is that so? Otou-san and Okaa-san didn’t say anything to me but……could it be, they’re expecting this from me?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In reality, Cyril never even considered offering his daughter to be Baldr’s concubine at the slightest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Cyril was a conservative person with deep loyalty. He wasn’t a man who would offer his own daughter for the sake of climbing up in life.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so, as a parent he would rejoice from his heart if his lord’s son fell in love with his daughter.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A large part of Seyruun’s mother Recella(リセラ) was also having such an expectation inside her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Either way, the only definite thing was that Seyruun’s parents didn’t intend to push her into a marriage that she didn’t wish for.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She might become Baldr’s concubine──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Just by having such thought a planted inside her, Seyruun didn’t have the confidence that she would be able to look at Baldr straight in the eye.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even though their relationship was like a big sister and a spoiled little brother until now, she couldn’t imagine herself meeting Baldr’s expectation if he sought her as a woman.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Is something wrong Sey-nee?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「UHyAAAAAHH!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun let out a completely unfeminine scream and bent backward reflexively.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr had returned to the mansion without her noticing. He was peering into Seyruun’s face with a worried expression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Too close! Young master! Your face is too close!」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「S-sorry. I didn’t expect that Sey-nee would be that shocked.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s handsome face that was inherited from Ignis appeared like a surprise attack. Seyruun pressed her hand on her heart that was pounding hard and backed away.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (No good. As expected my heart is beating too fast, I can’t look at the young master properly……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「There is something that I want to tell Sey-nee today.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Eeeee!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun whose brain was invaded by a pink flood became panicked thinking that perhaps this would be a confession. Even so she turned her gaze to Baldr with expectation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「About the thing that I’ve been doing lately in the city and keeping secret from Sey-nee……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Eh? This isn’t like what I’m expecting……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When she looked carefully, Baldr was staring at her with a very serious expression.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even Seyruun whose experience in romance was immature could grasp that Baldr’s expression wasn’t one that was delirious with the heat of love.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     When she realized that, she became ashamed by her flustered self just now and writhed inside her heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Sheesh! This is because that stupid Mathilda told me something strange.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr had no way of knowing that conflict in Seyruun’s heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He thought that there was something strange with Seyruun, but he childishly thought that it was because of him hiding things from her.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Actually I became friends with some children in the city a little while ago and planted a certain potato together with them. Well, that potato now become a source of sugar……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Haa? Sugar from a potato!?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun forgot her brain that almost boiled up from shame just now and shrieked. She never heard of sugar, which was a product from the south, being produced in the Cornelius territory.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If this wasn’t Baldr who was saying it, she would have seriously suspected the person who told her that wasn’t right in the head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Sey-nee knows that there are other people’s memories inside me right?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun nodded wordlessly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun was chosen to be Baldr’s maid exactly because of that circumstance.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She recalled Baldr in his early years. He would suddenly talk in a language that she never heard before, and then he would return back to a normal boy who was attracted to children’s toys. He was an emotionally unstable boy at that time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After she observed him for a while, she noticed that the cause was the personalities of two people inside Baldr, who seemed to be older than even Seyruun.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Since then, Seyruun came to hate these two.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Until two years ago, Seyruun would accompany Baldr not only when eating and sleeping, but even when he was taking a bath. It was in order to protect the ego of the young Baldr and also to affirm his childishness.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun’s ears were dyed red when she recalled something unnecessary, but Baldr continued without noticing that.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m planning to use those memories to try various things for the sake of this territory. Tou-san also said that I can do as I like if it’s using my own allowance.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was Baldr’s own interpretation of Ignis’s words at his own convenience.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Certainly Ignis told him 「Use your allowance as you like」, but there was no way he would even imagine that Baldr would use that money to raise a new industry.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Why has the young master been keeping it a secret until now?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Sorry, as expected I got the feeling that I would be made light of if a kid like me said it. I would be really shocked if I was laughed at by Sey-nee.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Actually he feared that Sey-nee would expose his whole plan to Ignis, but he also wasn’t lying when he said that he didn’t want to be laughed at.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     After all no matter what anyone said, Seyruun was the opposite sex closest to Baldr and someone he cared about.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Besides, Tou-san doesn’t have the awareness to monopolize the benefit of this to the Cornelius territory alone……)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Ignis was a just and upright person and also a peerless general, but he could only get failing marks as a bureaucrat.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He could be entrusted with the protection of the kingdom as a general, but he was decisively lacking the necessary evil for a feudal lord to enrich the Cornelius territory even if he had to harm other territories for it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter how much time passed, Cornelius territory’s military affairs would stay destitute without any improvement if its feudal lord could only be magnanimous in attempting co-existence and co-prosperity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「But finally my effort is going to be on track. Growing the potato itself isn’t that difficult, and fortunately Selina will also take care of its marketing.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「……Who is this Selina?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun let out a voice so cold that it surprised even herself.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This was the first time Seyruun realized that it would be this unpleasant hearing the name of an unknown woman from Baldr’s lips.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s sixth sense turned on some loud alarm bells in response to Seyruun’s low growl, but he was unable to guess the reason behind this bad premonition.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「S-she is the president of Savaran Company. I got acquainted with her two years ago, and since then we’re getting along well……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「H~~~m. How old is she? Is she pretty?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「If I remember right, she should be 18 years old right now. And as for her look, well she is really pretty but, more than that her fluffy dog ears are the best──」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr realized that Seyruun’s expression had become like a noh mask in the middle of saying that. It was an expression that he never saw Seyruun make in the five years that they’ve been living together.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (I see……so young master was getting cosy with other woman while I’m fretting like this.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’m happy that the young master is sharing your secret with me. From now on, please don’t hide anything like this from me anymore and tell me everything.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Y-yeah……got it. After all I think I’ll need Sey-nee’s help more from here on.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I see, you can count on me.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He wondered why. Baldr had nothing but bad premonitions even though he was able to persuade Seyruun successfully like this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun’s new side that he never knew until now──or rather her dark side made Baldr unable to hide his bewilderment.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     He would learn in the near future that his premonition wasn’t mistaken.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Setting aside the concubine thing……I need to watch out so that harmful insects won’t get closer to the young master. Urgently.)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In the end Seyruun was still unable to find the answer to whether this murky feeling in her chest was love or familial affection.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But at the very least, she was certain that she didn’t want to allow an unknown woman get closer to Baldr than this.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Part 8
    </span>
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr’s expectation wasn’t betrayed. The gold plated works sold like hot cakes.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Only great nobles of the kingdom were able to purchase something as expensive as real gold works regularly. The likes of small and middle level nobles would only be able to purchase such things a few times in their life for momentous events like marriage ceremonies.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     However, if they were able to obtain something as beautiful at a price that was lower than a tenth of the real thing, it was only human nature to want to dress up their wife or daughter with it for the sake of vanity.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The gold plated artwork immediately became popular among the nobles. Their delicate design that possessed depth to them without being too garish was evaluated highly. Finally people who desired them even started to appear among the great nobles.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Its scarcity value will decrease if too much of it is produced. I don’t mind if the boss creates them following your own pace.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「That’s a relief. It’s not my nature to cut corners with my work.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Gothe’s expression was overflowing with happiness due to finally being able to produce a work that he was satisfied with.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The “Gothe Collection” suddenly started circulating in the city, and yet the circulated amount was too small compared to the demand.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Inquiries from merchants that wished to place an order to the mysterious artisan came one after another to Savaran Company that was the origin of of the artwork’s sale to the market, but Selina firmly refused those inquiries.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Come back yesterday.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     It was obvious that if she naively introduced them to Gothe, they would pile up a lot of money to headhunt Gothe to work for them. It wouldn’t stop with that, they might even try forceful methods like kidnapping.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     But the plating method which was the most important factor in this product’s commercial value was Baldr’s secret technique. Gothe had sworn to the blacksmith god Manos that he wouldn’t reveal this information to an outsider.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Even so the movement to investigate Gothe’s true identity hadn’t ceased even now, but no matter which lead they followed, nobody in the kingdom fit the profile of the gold artisan Gothe.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Though if it was just a very normal artisan who was dealing in trifling folk craft then such a person existed.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「The new goods that Baldr invented are also selling well……ukuku. I can’t stop laughin’……」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The amount of money that Savaran Company obtained in just half a year could only be described as a great sum.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Although the amount still couldn’t compare with the great companies in the capital, it had completely surpassed the level of a company in the countryside.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Furthermore this growth had only just started. She got a vague feeling of fear just from imagining how big the company would grow in the future.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     If there was just one miscalculation in Selina’s thought when things were smooth sailing like this──
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Excuse me, miss president.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A beautiful girl with brown blond hair bowing with a headdress snugly placed on her head.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The figure of the boy who was usually beside that girl couldn’t be found there.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Where is Baldr?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
<img src="img/136.jpg"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Young master is busy with supervising at the scene right now.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Ya liarrrr! Ya’re the one who stopped him from coming here!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina restrained herself from yelling with much effort and smiled warmly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She had understood from the first time they met, not by logic but by her womanly instinct.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <ruby>
     This woman
     <rt>
      Seyruun
     </rt>
    </ruby>
    was an enemy.
   </p>
   <p>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Going back in time half a year ago.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr who pulled in Seyruun to be his ally brought her to Savaran Company in order to introduce her. Seyruun would take the role as the one getting in contact with the company from here on.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     For some reason, at that time when she was introduced Seyruun gave some additional words with an extremely nice smile.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Selina, let me introduce you. She is my maid Seyruun, someone who is like a big sister to me. She will help out with various things from now on. Please get along well with her.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「It’s nice to meet you. I hope we can get along well just like how you and young master are.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     A gaze that seemed to be appraising Selina could be seen appearing and disappearing in Seyruun’s gaze while she introduced herself. It convinced Selina that Seyruun was her rival.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Now this is a really adorable big sister you have there. I hope we can get along too (Aren’t ya still a kid. Ya gotta get in my way?)」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Me too. As expected from the president of a company, you have this presence in you. No wonder Baldr-sama relied on you. (Don’t joke around when your face itself is already a joke. This isn’t a stage where a middle-aged woman should appear!)」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The two of them were giving a friendly smile to each other cordially, and yet Baldr felt like there was ice running down his back.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun and Selina calmly evaluated each other.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The victory flag was raised on Selina’s side in regard to maturity as a woman. It wouldn’t be easy for Seyruun to compete with Selina’s tight waist and voluptuous chest.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun’s fleshiness was already at a bit of a disadvantage even when compared to other girls her age.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     She heard that there were also men who felt that such a slender body like hers was charming, but the only opinion that mattered here was Baldr’s. It was still unknown where his tastes lay.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In looks too, Selina was a classic beauty who anyone would recognize as pretty, and in contrast Seyruun was a cute type beauty that looked commonplace someway or another.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     There was a possibility that she might transform radically as she aged, but Seyruun herself was aware enough that she wouldn’t be that outstanding even in the future.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     In contrast Selina herself also couldn’t feel so assured.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     No matter how, Seyruun’s intimacy with Baldr that came from the two of them spending time together since they were little was a threat. It was to a degree that she would want to win her over to her side if only they weren’t enemies.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Besides, it was envious that their age was close to one another.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The difference in age between Selina and Baldr was actually seven years. She would be 27 when Baldr became 20.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun who was only two years older from Baldr would be 22 when Baldr was 20. She would be at her peak as a woman. Selina was unable to make light of this difference.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     As the result of their analysis of each other’s strong and weak points, Selina decided to settle the match as soon as possible while Seyruun chose to prolong the match as long as possible.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Seyruun was visiting Selina alone like this to get in contact with her, and this was also one part of her fight.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     .
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「About the message from the young master, he said that he wishes to procure quicklime and volcanic ash this time.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Haa? I can still understand if it’s quicklime, but what does he need volcanic ash for?」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Young master mentioned something about attempting to create Roman concrete next.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Baldr had spewed out words that couldn’t be made into an explanation as always. Selina looked up to the sky in exasperation.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     At the same time, it was also a fact that there was an expectation rising inside herself that was looking forward to what he would create this time.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I’ll prepare a wagon of them before the end of next week. Ya go ahead and tell Baldr that.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Thank you very much. I’ll be sure to tell the young master so.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「He owes me one with this.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Unfortunately, I didn’t hear anything about that from the young master.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     (Kuh……at this rate the guard will keep hardening with me unable to do anythin’!)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     Selina clicked her tongue in her heart.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「Then, guess I need to consider going to meet him directly to collect the debt.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     「I shall prevent that with everything I have.」
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     The gazes of the two beauties clashed and they chuckled ‘fufufu’ to each other boldly.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">
     This fight between women was heating up more and more like this, but this battle wouldn’t get out of hand with their position as fellow women who wished to help a single man. It could only be said as admirable.
